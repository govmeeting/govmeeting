https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-AK95bi3Qs


0:04

welcome to the Monday july twenty for the selected recording secretary calorie


0:11

count and selected for when he walked myself to be driven my taco


0:20

let's move right


0:26

and how do you have for us tonight


0:30

thank you the thing they have tonight is the basketball court up


0:36

I've been keeping an important and I sense some stuff out today engineers


0:43

laying out the schematics of where the tent or via the reason I bring it up


0:51

tonight


0:51

is that what seed found laying out the area designs or agree on getting it feat


1:00

one interferes with full post area of football field and you recommend


1:06

Freeman parallel street as kind of course work


1:11

so today i turn it off this is running way that shows the schematics of that


1:17

and he's at the point now where he's ready to just sign off on stormwater


1:24

evaluation at that point I think we're very close to having all materials ready


1:31

for us


1:33

the dep permitting one of the things that Lauren stuff when I talk about that


1:38

this may have to go to the Planning Board to before we continue because it's


1:43

a paid service


1:44

that's considered structure so I'm not thinking this is going to go through


1:50

particularly quickly itself


1:52

just keep you posted with Steve wanted to have the board review just the


1:58

positioning of the two courts and get some feedback whether that was


2:02

acceptable around


2:03

so that's why bring that up


2:09

it looks fine


2:11

yeah


2:16

and you know perhaps it's just worth mentioning for people watching


2:22

select the meeting that because this is sort of goes into wetland or sort of the


2:30

drainage areas that requires the sort of permitting


2:35

step back setbacks and things like that one might think it would be easy to just


2:41

level up with a tennis court on and unfortunately the nature land such that


2:46

this requires required reading for the audience might be wondering why it's


2:53

taking so long


2:55

yeah and also learn is that this does require from the will show this with


3:03

that as well so right


3:06

you seem to have most of our ducks in a row here progressing really well and


3:11

also sent out last few weeks .


3:14

Layton's proposals for floor


3:21

I didn't include that tonight because this is really just a conversation with


3:25

positioning the courts but the Lord could pose to accept your knives keep


3:33

the process for ya


3:35

looks fine to me too Tom I'm i get some left wondering how we miss that close


3:43

proximity to the goal post last time we thought I can sort of answer the ultra


3:50

you want when when Chris and I went down there first and came up with just a


3:55

concept of how these were laid out it was this way because we'd go out and


4:00

measure how that go


4:02

yeah when they were conceptual sketches down on it


4:06

they want to scale they were more were sort of artsy and cartooning right so


4:11

they didn't have the actual visions on them and once you've got pretty actual


4:16

dimensions of with you know that that layout in with a head cold is not so


4:21

good


4:24

school right I'm going on a date on the page that you have on top you can see it


4:32

as a dotted line there that shows where the original plan was if it was going to


4:37

be going


4:38

kitty corner yeah and you go right at that goes right out even to the gold


4:41

coast


4:42

nice so it's encroaching on the school you


4:46

and we got enough clearance so the drainage area


4:52

yes because I it is quite a bit closer


4:56

following the bumper that we need there we had a lot of extra room when it was


5:02

in its kitty corner position right now we still have enough


5:05

ok


5:09

what I just like to mention a couple of things i like afternoon your blood and


5:19

email from one rock wall


5:21

well excuse me . well and she recommended that the file the plan with


5:29

the landscaping happy things with the state


5:35

p because it's part of it I don't feel like the whole concept right


5:41

the whole concept


5:42

and even if we implemented some phase that's my understanding that one state


5:49

proves that we have


5:51

I'm five to seven years you might want to find out how long we have to actually


5:56

simple that things we want to do it with an ear


6:00

no my understanding ok so that's number one


6:03

um number two I still think it's really important that we that we really talked


6:15

about and even if we don't do the landscaping all at once that we at least


6:19

actually implement that


6:25

well what was originally called the firm area or whatever by the parking lot that


6:31

will be prepared


6:36

escaping I because i don't want to start this project then have it kind of be


6:41

forgotten and never get actually because that was really part of the


6:45

beautification that was what i really felt at least for me personally that was


6:51

mine


6:52

hot but i really wanted this they are yet to be approved and the person who


6:57

made the most original motion actually happens to be sitting


7:01

I'm I ok mr. Hamm what an opportunity in case you want to say anything for this


7:10

I've only seen that playing on a little tiny screen so hard for me to tell but


7:14

how wide is the green space between the road and the parking lot and how many


7:21

parking spaces are shown on here


7:23

there are 36 and leave over there now and we'll go down to 28 parking spaces


7:30

ok and that raised sidewalk area that's there now


7:35

I believe it's 11 feet across yeah that's not going to cut it but we're


7:40

going to send it into the parking lot right away from what does that plan show


7:44

that that's my question


7:45

yes does this plan so what it says remove pavement create landscape such a


7:56

small feel like everything


7:58

yeah this study


8:02

yes


8:09

see I believe this drawing the parking lot is not what we passed and that is


8:18

not compliant with the current codes of the car so i would hate the file this


8:23

and then write have to go back and fix it because it's not the right


8:32

because this this shows the original


8:35

30 35 that parking spots and we all agreed that we were going to go down to


8:42

do this plan


8:44

John layman's language education the correct


8:47

yeah this one here is I believe just for additional reports


8:52

I got no problem repositioning the course I think that's fine


8:55

that was what i do i would have a problem with finding this because the


9:00

party


9:01

- right right we need a pilot accurate light and I think that also one


9:06

anyway finally bows dad we have to before planning for it out that sort


9:11

that all


9:11

yeah this isn't gonna be done right away good


9:14

you want to do it right so why would i would suggest that your motion should be


9:20

we accept the repositioning of the courts and not mentioned that you're


9:26

implying acceptance of this drawing


9:29

that's always looking for and we're all aware that the ball for size has


9:34

increased due to the was it


9:37

choir members thought about adding drainage yeah he's also change the


9:42

dimension someone at the basketball court just to give some out of bounds


9:46

area rather than four inches and we have the space available to do that so that


9:50

didn't seem substantial with it feels like a lot of paved a lot of heart


9:57

escapes


9:58

so that's why I i would agree with Denise that anything we can do to


10:01

increase or to make sure we have vegetation and offering is a high


10:08

priority for many years and that's part of the design of the parking lot is to


10:12

add more green space add add the bolsters on the side can add more green


10:17

space to that and make it compliant with our current code to clothes


10:21

I think we're on the same page


10:25

good ok so this election to prove the repositioning


10:32

the wall and the last call for as depicted in the diagram so good


10:38

ok one more push yeah and we're just so whose job is it to get the sketch of big


10:48

well we've got three people working at the same time we've got orange is


10:52

overseeing the whole process we have done late


10:55

the vegetation plans which actually shows the parking lot


10:59

correct again Steve robbers took this basically because it was in digital form


11:06

and you can work with it and so the parking lot is not accurate on here but


11:11

as far as what he needs to the stormwater calculation as far as


11:14

improving service so forth


11:16

this is this work for him but to answer your question we get to you know the


11:21

point we're going to follow the education you have the documents all the


11:25

same


11:26

all completely accurate so we're going yet


11:30

so you'll work with us folks to come up with the proper night Brandon


11:35

the proper diagram will the planning for it yeah yeah yeah we're going to talk


11:41

about this a lot every day so I'm going back home in French so we'll go back to


11:46

the selectmen and that's it


11:48

working to get the final review and approval or we can do whatever you want


11:53

we got a possibility to do everything we need right there when you have the


11:58

hallway


11:59

I don't think i'm going to break ground with this fall so I don't think I'm so


12:03

that's my next question what is your breasts gets well this would be finished


12:09

i mean i right


12:10

the next step is going to go through the budget process in december january march


12:17

we're gonna have to raise some more money because the cost estimates are


12:20

over what we set aside already think we set aside roughly 30,000 and I think our


12:24

total cost estimates which may be a little like if we don't have to do all


12:28

the planning but I can give us 58,000 so we've got to put some more money


12:34

head for that my plan would be to start with like what you're talking about the


12:38

side of the road


12:39

education making pretty you get to the courts afterwards but at least make that


12:45

core and i think that's it


12:49

most likely to be spring because i think i think with all the rights Public Works


12:53

has to do


12:54

preparing for the winter event here and so forth and finally this one is that I


12:58

don't think we're going to get this going to fall


13:00

I love to but


13:01

primary analyst with that


13:08

all right I think we have developed motion unless there are other questions


13:11

or comments


13:12

right okay all hangar


13:15

thank you all right


13:20

okay great do we have any selected reports about you can only develop else


13:35

go ahead winning


13:38

well just briefly i think most everyone here that there was a story and


13:44

solicitations with soliciting input from the town and readers in the restaurant


13:50

name for the winter event that's been collected and marketing subgroup is


14:00

reviewing all the responses we have a lot of people away in some with their


14:05

own suggestions and a lot of people picking some of them


14:09

favorite naming times that were suggested I don't know when they're


14:15

going to announce the final names for the sort of branding of the winter


14:20

events but it was fun we participate in that and make it really Jen up a lot of


14:27

general interest and support from residents and businesses


14:31

we also have a first meeting of the way finding group and expanded our group to


14:40

invite a few additional members particularly inviting 10 huber from


14:46

edgecombe to join us so that we have south for the harbor and edgecombe


14:51

focusing on the way finding and ted has accepted that invitation and we've


14:57

extended the invitation to a few others including my compost and Mike


15:02

spearheaded the brandy work that was going on with the peninsula and that


15:09

will be very informative for the designers that we


15:12

the plan . the signage and wayfinding so those are sort of the limited updates


15:19

ok right so from the ambulance service that the big events there was a


15:28

groundbreaking ceremony yesterday afternoon at the in the parking lot but


15:36

near the site of the new ambulance building and Robbie cam did a nice job


15:43

introducing the project explaining the size of the building and and he had a


15:49

couple of interesting statistics one of which was that the ambulance service had


15:56

64 calls in the first nine days of july this year so they're definitely into


16:04

their busy season and nearly a thousand calls in the first half of this year so


16:10

plenty of activity


16:13

they're all cool all was also there and said a few words to the the small crowds


16:21

that was gathered the event was combined with a picnic or recognition and thank


16:31

you


16:31

appreciation picnic for the ambulance service employees and there were about I


16:38

would say half a dozen


16:39

or so of them their most of the folks that were on call at the time but it was


16:45

great to say hello and express appreciation for all that they do so we


16:52

can look forward to things getting under way down there and i think by November


16:56

we would like to be moving in to that facility so that's gonna happen pretty


17:02

quick once they get no good right


17:08

thank you for the day my handles you have before you revenue and expense


17:14

sheets total revenue year today 70 1300 negative 1 dollars and 23 seconds total


17:20

expenses here today three hundred fifty thousand men and 2095 as you can see


17:26

these are the few months here before our taxes are permitted that the expenses


17:31

are definitely larger than the revenue until you've committed the tax and where


17:38

I think we're committing them if getting about have been working on the personal


17:43

growth rate was going to


17:44

by the end of the week we will have committed within the next week so and


17:51

total accounts payable is 240 7576 dollars in ninety-seven cents the bank


17:57

balance is 1 million eight hundred fifty nine thousand


18:01

the five dollars and seventy cents did anyone have any questions on the menu


18:04

except it's not about where we are


18:08

revenue and expenses to go out on bail


18:11

so it is probably right now july and until we actually met the taxes it's a


18:17

war on target for the expenses it's because we have like the monthly school


18:23

bell up to a thousand so the expenses windy so we need to pay monthly


18:32

okay thank you


18:36

so only for a motion for approval from the night to the joy rolling meeting


18:43

yes i have as I had a minor so


18:49

all right all right all right all bigger


18:55

yeah yeah i just asked if we get Songz spoke correctly that one of your


19:03

operation


19:04

it was it this time


19:07

I'm sure we get them


19:12

yeah oh yeah looks and your wedding


19:18

yeah very nice little guy created in your nine years I don't even know where


19:25

ok so moving on


19:33

we have one like our license to consider approval tonight official war and has


19:45

initial bet


19:49

move that we approve that price and i'll say it


19:59

so do you want to have any discussion or any comments from the audience


20:05

seeing none all in favor is right on our agenda


20:17

we don't have any old business or new business listed here today


20:24

well we do have some new business


20:32

ok well i just want to bring up that I think Jeff it provided these could be up


20:40

okay thank you I receive the few questions and complaints about the yard


20:50

sale -


20:51

it seems to be a more continuous yard sale that's right


20:57

you also receive a call and you know I wasn't sure we have ordinances so I


21:06

asked to look into that in terms of whether we had things sort of providing


21:14

diets for length of time one can have a yard sale or the parameters around that


21:19

just reading of our code is that we did however he provided tonight some


21:26

examples of this one that we have in front of us is from a town in


21:34

Pennsylvania that has some code ordinances that might be


21:40

helpful in terms of the parameters around


21:45

how long what you have a yard sale or garage sale


21:50

you know the number of times the type of preventing at cetera and I just wanted


21:58

to bring it up it make something for us to discuss and I assume that this is


22:06

within the perfect selected talked about this the other groups that I will pass


22:15

it to the Planning Board has to have a recommendation


22:18

right right i mean certainly discuss it but i think i think when it would be


22:24

helpful if we have suggestions opinions to pass them on and simply a lady board


22:30

chair here today


22:31

this device is of high school will very easy


22:36

I and comments back if if I may I think I think you do have some tools on hand


22:43

should you want to pursue them


22:46

somebody learn ordered me to this and I took a look at our codes and there is a


22:50

license required for pedaling and soliciting and there is some implication


22:57

about time scale to the restoration windy in this and that and that


23:01

it talks about a license for a year of five hundred dollars or a 10-day license


23:08

for a hundred dollars which seems to indicate to me that there's some


23:11

activity that's going on for 10 days in town you perhaps needs to be licensed


23:17

and you might inquire whether this operation has such a license or not


23:22

that's very helpful you know what the statute says no person shall Walker


23:30

pedal good where's the merchandise at retail within the town without a license


23:33

therefore it should be construed to mean include all persons both principals and


23:37

agents who engage in temporary or transient business in this town either


23:41

in one locality or traveling from place to place selling goods where's


23:45

merchandise and who for the purpose of carrying out such business higher lease


23:49

or occupy any property building structure for the exhibition and sale of


23:55

goods where's the merchandise to sell goods where's merchandising retail from


23:58

a car wagon or other conveyance steamer or vessel


24:02

I continuous yard sale strikes me as being a business in town and should have


24:08

a license


24:12

from the case and then then


24:17

I think that's a discussion with it and that's in your court yeah yeah yeah


24:28

I think the other interesting than that maybe I mean I were some discussion is


24:37

with the Planning Board wanna at some point in the fall and winter have a


24:46

conversation and concerning I think I just might have some input and on this


24:53

but would it make sense to think about having our ordinance be more similar to


25:00

the town boom bass know and i certainly agree that we ought to take a look at


25:07

yard sales because they're they're big activity and I did I suspect the same


25:12

thing Jeff did is I took our codes and I search for yard sales and there is


25:15

nothing there absolutely nothing


25:18

so having something that addresses that if it's only a definition


25:22

I can conceive with having a definition that says somebody offers sales of goods


25:26

for the duration of two days


25:28

you know that falls below some threshold and have at it and have fun but if it is


25:33

going to run for 10 days that you need to do something about right now we don't


25:37

have that


25:38

thank you perfect shells


25:39

seat sale sign in the state sale


25:42

yeah yes you don't sing yeah the sample for all products and the stake sale plz


25:49

heart


25:50

yeah yeah okay so we need to clear a blocked nose - yeah yeah I'm trying to


25:54

get away from using those words to go to a definition


25:56

yes this sample or if its food


26:01

garage yard sale tags self-portrait exhale be balanced out the heart itself


26:07

or any similar casual sale manageable ready to go


26:11

yeah I think that's inclusive so i'll try and put that on a typical was for us


26:18

to consider at some point in the near future


26:22

okay to be great this


26:26

I think that it just helped provide some guidance and some reasonable limits we


26:32

don't want to limit people from having a casual yard sandals


26:37

fun summer activities


26:40

cents on and on


26:42

that's different


26:45

like on some research as well and i can forward to the information that would be


26:51

great


26:52

I have a nice reference of time right has loosely defined as a garage sale is


27:00

something of a limited time frame work something longer than that they call it


27:04

the market aura or get tense a land that has a definable limits


27:11

damariscotta does not have anything other than talking about the signs of


27:15

sizes and the size of science and the right away and then I


27:22

wiscasset is similar to talk about


27:28

putting together the food bank that's great example i sent you as well as


27:31

average that few others have have sent to me


27:34

neighbors that have been concerned yeah


27:38

yes what's not differentiated set sail


27:42

Marcus not even your copy of this sharp


27:48

so wrong he's asking thanks for your help


27:53

just follow the chains


27:58

yeah great now that trust


28:03

stopping for a very crowded patient right right


28:07

we're going that my stuff to wrap up and that's what people need to operate


28:12

within our witnesses with any one of us may not like and Warren Institute but


28:18

thats to bad people


28:21

so okay great thanks very much


28:26

thank you hey all right


28:30

any other new business before I go too well


28:36

well I guess we're going to call it a public forum but I think I still has


28:40

some kind of seven year old business to bring up with us


28:44

I do for all your us all right so up at the last planning book working i was


28:53

asked to get a sense of the select board from the issue of starting the new short


28:58

land zoning rules that have been propagated by the state and


29:02

you may recall that the state has issued a complete new rework the shore lands


29:08

owned as a new rework it is it is mostly very similar to the current one but it


29:12

is different and some some some important ways but there is no mandate


29:18

or requirement that the town adopt those rules by any specific date


29:22

it says here they are and we'd like you to adopt them but as I said there is no


29:25

mandate and as we have begun to look into that and to see which parts of the


29:32

rule that we think we should adopt and perhaps which parts we should not


29:37

there's been some differing interpretations about exactly what must


29:40

be adopted and to greatly simplify a bunch of back and forth sand and


29:45

knowledge exchanges the planning board with the exception of one member has


29:50

felt that we should retain our existing rules on expanding pre-existing


29:54

non-conforming structures within 75 feet and those rules basically say that if


30:01

you have a structure that has not been previously expanded you can expand by


30:05

thirty percent in either floor area or volume whichever is most restrictive and


30:11

we've had that for some number of years since I think about nineteen eighteen I


30:14

so people are kind of used to it


30:17

the


30:19

state


30:23

are somewhat different from that and somewhat more lenient in some areas and


30:26

some more restrictive than others


30:29

we don't have to get into that so we asked our town wire about what it would


30:34

take to implement most of these new state rules but to keep our existing the


30:39

time lawyer felt we might be leaving ourselves open for a lawsuit if we do


30:42

not adopt the entire new dep you however are dep representative stated that we


30:51

certainly have the right to retain our current rules and the dep would not


30:55

challenge us if we were to do so


30:57

so we've got a little bit of a very great


31:00

salutary very it is very great and and Jeff is I think also trying to get an


31:07

opinion from MMA sort of a third independent parties to how they might


31:11

feel for this and and


31:14

blog I'll get in my personal opinion in a few minutes up but certainly there may


31:21

be some value in waiting to see this resolved somewhat more either by what


31:26

other towns do or if there is a court case that resolves this the likelihood


31:31

of a court case i think is fairly remote or the legislature may pass mandate and


31:38

says it's been kicking around long enough you've got to do it but that


31:42

hasn't happened yet so it is planning board's understanding that the town had


31:47

wanted to hold a special town meeting this fall or in some reasonable time


31:51

frame at some point to adopt or not whatever the short short lands little


31:56

rules that make it through our respective ports and again the process


32:01

is the Planning Board will come up with


32:04

set of recommended rules and pass the Selectboard this light board will hold


32:09

public hearings on that and then determine what goes on the worn for the


32:13

special town meeting so I think that question to you or the key question in


32:19

my mind to you is how committed are you to resolving this into this fall or or


32:26

could we wait some more while some of these things


32:28

hash out and while we're waiting we're current we would operate under our


32:32

current bylaws which vast majority of the planning board thinks are the ones


32:37

that we should retain with regard to expanding pre-existing non-conforming


32:42

gives a lot of the other changes are clarifications of definitions things


32:46

that really don't change the tenor of the short end zone


32:49

so that's my first question well I


32:55

I guess my current thinking is that i think we can probably wait i will say


33:03

that i think when we were at their public


33:06

there was a public hearing at it up like the day that changed it wasn't really


33:12

widely publicized


33:15

so we think that it was one of those people here or so


33:19

yeah that you know just just sent out a letter with his first almost a year ago


33:23

now


33:24

- all shoreland owners and said hey this is coming down the pike


33:30

but it's been a long time and the interest has not been in the front of


33:34

everybody's behind had one applicant who is hoping that the new rules are adopted


33:39

because it would allow them to do what they want to do for our current loans


33:44

would be a little bit more restrictive and I can't speak for Jeff but i think


33:48

just between a rock and a hard place at the moment


33:51

yeah its applications which rules are we going by and so that would be helpful


33:56

12 no I think we're clear but where the rules are going by right now I think I


34:00

think just a hard place about


34:03

I'm not sure you feel strongly about one way or the other although he has said


34:08

publicly in our meetings that he would prefer that we carry on


34:11

our existing rules one reason that one rationale the state gave was that these


34:17

new rules would be easier to enforce because they go to footprint not area


34:21

and volume and just comment and my feeling as well as we really haven't had


34:28

a problem


34:28

calculating area and volume that seems to be within our tools that we've been


34:33

talking for a long time and therefore we didn't see the difficulty that the state


34:38

was attempting to respond to


34:42

so what does what does the new rules at thirty percent the new rules as i said


34:50

says footprint


34:52

you can expand thirty percent of your footprint so Carrie area only accept it


34:57

makes it calls out structures that are closer than 25 feet to the shore and


35:04

makes it those more restrictive and we have a number of structures that are


35:08

right hard on the shore and so and in fact we were playing board just approved


35:13

an expansion at our last meeting that I believe would not have been permitted


35:17

under the state's new rules so as I said it's morning in one regard that you can


35:22

you can add more volume than thirty percent if you can do it within your


35:26

footprint you could put on a whole second story for example and as long as


35:29

you're under the height restriction that would be


35:31

ok but it is more restrictive for those people who have structures that are very


35:37

close to the to the water and it has a set of cascading rules for people within


35:43

25 feet and fifty feet and height restrictions as you go back from the


35:48

water so it's not a it's not a clear


35:52

yay or nay on this


35:56

so Phil it sounds like the planning board with the perhaps one exception has


36:02

not had a human cry from the residents here to move to a different system


36:10

current crack crack we had one applicant who would like to move to the new system


36:13

because it would enable them to do what their plans are but other than that we


36:21

have not had much public response and we really need to get drum up some more


36:25

interest and support response which we will do through additional public


36:29

hearings and you guys will have a public area


36:31

you know there is there is a process for doing that but I my personal feeling is


36:37

that I since it is not mandated since the current rules seem to be working


36:42

well for boothbay harbor


36:44

I don't I don't see a particular rush if we can get some more information and


36:51

more information to me I think comes from from two places one is external


36:55

information will be many lawyers have a different spin will will other towns


37:00

adopt this


37:02

so yeah it's working great and we have any trouble or we'll have some


37:05

difficulties and and the second source of information will be internal we can


37:09

do a survey


37:11

you know it will be absolutely complete but we could do a real survey of how


37:17

many structures we have that might be impacted by has changed to see if this


37:21

one application is represents the tip of the iceberg or is it an isolated case I


37:25

I think it's the latter


37:27

I think we have many more residential homes that are very close that then


37:34

commercial operations that we want to expand trying on and they haven't


37:39

already used up there thirty percent you know these these expansions are a


37:42

once-in-a-lifetime effect once you once you have expanded within the shoulder


37:47

and so you're done


37:48

so bill is there any possibility the entity that like to use the newer


37:57

regulations


37:59

is there any capacity within the current rules for things like variances or


38:09

whatever and


38:10

- loud as it was I understand I understand your question


38:17

I just you're in there's a lot of the king is not allowed to give variances on


38:22

the thirty percent that's that's just you can't um I think they're my personal


38:28

feeling this is my personal feeling and I think it's shared by some of the


38:31

planning for but not necessarily all I think there are some creative things


38:35

that could be done in trading off existing buildings that are going to get


38:41

demolished and you can use that area and volume and bring it over to another


38:45

building and I think they could accomplish much of what they want want


38:49

to accomplish


38:50

I don't think they could accomplish all of what they would want to accomplish


38:54

I think they would they're their final result under the new rules would in fact


38:57

be a smaller building under the old rules would be a smaller building than


39:03

what they could do under the new rules


39:05

I think that's probably true but I don't think it's I don't think it's forbidden


39:08

under the current rules that just think that we have to be a little bit smaller


39:11

and I don't think anybody's works through those numbers


39:15

all right I'll just carry yet they like the idea of the internal holding or


39:22

research being done looking at maybe a few structure yet and see how would an


39:30

expansion and either of those shake out the one direction or another


39:34

I know our comp plan topic and


39:37

development and possibility so maybe that would give us a bit more clarity as


39:42

to write whether this was good to adopt or yeah that and that's the argument of


39:46

the planning board member of the favors going to the new rules as he believes it


39:50

would start economic development more


39:54

I because of the 25-foot role and i don't personally believe that it would I


39:58

don't think we have that many cases in town but it's a noble thing we could do


40:02

that research and try and come to answer to that question and actually see it as


40:07

a homeowner


40:08

I would actually find that plan a bit more restrictive only because it


40:13

requires you to make sure where the 25-foot and fifty foot setback are and


40:19

the plans that we receive are already detailed and that additional line of


40:23

detail and then slit calculation


40:26

yeah it does kind of money for it


40:29

mike and i will say i don't i'm not hard over on this


40:35

I think the current our current rules would be better but i am not i don't


40:38

think they are vastly better than the new state


40:41

I'm not hard over I just think there's like better and part of my thinking for


40:46

that my personal thing for that is because I think consistency has some


40:50

value and I hate to be changing the rules that people have become gives - I


40:56

don't know how many homeowners are out there saying it's something i'm going to


40:59

add on my thirty percent and and then you change the rules on and they can't


41:04

that's that's not a good situation right and and and that that gets back to left


41:09

lined . if we I think another reason for postponing making the decision is that I


41:19

just think it needs a lot more complication it's more


41:23

yes sir we agreed you'd agree entirely so I'm okay okay


41:30

yes thank you


41:33

okay good


41:36
