<p>

  This is an open source project whose goal is to involve people more in their local governments. <br>
  The Github project is at: <a href="https://github.com/govmeeting/govmeeting"> Govmeeting Github Project </a> <br>
  Links with an asterisk are components partially completed. Other links describe components to be built.

  <h3> <a [routerLink]="['/about']">About</a> </h3>

  The <a [routerLink]="['/about']">About</a> page explains a bit more about the project.

  <h3> <a [routerLink]="['/fixasr']">Fix ASR*</a> </h3>

  This demos a component for fixing errors in the text generated by the Auto Speech Recognition software.
  A user can watch and hear a portion of the meeting and correct the corresponding text.
  They can replay sections. There are two edit modes:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Insert Mode: A cursor appears when clicking in the text. What you type is inserted.
    </li>
    <li>
      Replace Mode: Click to highlight a word. What you type replaces the word. A space deletes it.
      The next word is then highlighted.
      This mode makes it easier to fix incorrect words. The user doesn't need to drag the mouse to highlight the text to correct.
    </li>
  </ul>
  If you save the corrections and log out, once you return it will go back to where you left off.<br>

  The recording is split into 3-minute sections. Multiple volunteers can be work on different sections of the same meeting transcript at the same time.
  Once all the sections are proofread, they will be put together and the entire transcript goes to the next stage in the process.<br />
  The user can also mark where the speaker changes and select or enter the name of the new speaker.

  <h3> <a [routerLink]="['/addtags']">Add Tags*</a> </h3>

  Tags are meta data that is added to the text. They include:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Section tags: The start of a new section. For example: Reading of Minutes, Reading of Bills, Public Comments, etc.
      Pre-processing will attempt to insert this information, if it is available or can de deduced from the transcript.
    </li>
    <li>
      Topic Tags: These indicate the start of a new topic of discussion. For example: "Repaving of Main St.", "Hiring of two policemen", etc.
    </li>
  </ul>
  This component tries to provide a quick and easy way to add such tags:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Highlighting a phrase of the text will insert that phrase into a text input box.
      The user can then (1) accept that phrase as the topic, (2) select a new phrase or (3) edit the selected phrase.
    </li>
    <li>
      The user can select a topic name from the drop-down combo box.
      This box is populated with topics that appeared in recent meetings of this government entity.
    </li>
    <li>
      The user can click the up or down arrows next to the section or topic name to move it to a different position in the text.
    </li>
    <li>
      The software hasn't yet implemented the insertion or removal of section tags.
    </li>
  </ul>
  It is important to assign clear topic names. The topic names are be used for:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Searching the text of prior meetings for discussion on ths this topic.
    </li>
    <li>
      Setting alerts for when this topic is discussed at future meetings.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3> <a [routerLink]="['/meeting']">Browse Meeting*</a> </h3>

  Once the transcript is completed, a browsable transcript is now available. There are many ways the data can now be displayed.
  The simple demo page allows a user to:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Click on a topic and see only what was said about that topic during the meeting.
    </li>
    <li>
      Click on a speaker name and see only what that person said during the meeting.
      To be more useful, we should display some of the surrounding context to what they said.
    </li>
  </ul>
  This demo is missing the section tags.

  <h3> <a [routerLink]="['/home']">Home Page</a> </h3>

  This current home page is just for demo. The
  <a [routerLink]="['/home']">Home Page</a> link shows what components will eventually be on the Home page. But these component have not yet been built.

  <h3> <a [routerLink]="['/volunteer']">Volunteer Page</a> </h3>

  This will be a page where volunteers can collaborate on getting the data ready for publishing. The
  <a [routerLink]="['/volunteer']">Volunteer Page</a> link shows what components will appear on it. But these component have not yet been built.

  <h3> <a [routerLink]="['/serverdemo']">Server Components</a> </h3>
