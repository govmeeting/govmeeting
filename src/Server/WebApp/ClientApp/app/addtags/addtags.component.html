  Section and topic names can be moved by clicking on the up/down arrows.
  Clicking on text opens a dialog box for entering a topic name. Highlighing words in the text pre-populates the input box.<br>
  Right now you can add topic names anywhere. But it makes more sense to limit this option to certain sections of the meeting.
