The library is for auto pre-processing recordings of meetings.
This includes code to:
* Monitor a location on the web for new recordings.
* Download the recording to Govmeeting.org.
* Split the recording into smaller segments which will be then auto transcribed.
* Auto-transcribe the segments of the recording using the Google Speech API.
* Re-merge the transcript segments.
* Convert the transcript into a JSON object which will be the input for further volunteer processing.
