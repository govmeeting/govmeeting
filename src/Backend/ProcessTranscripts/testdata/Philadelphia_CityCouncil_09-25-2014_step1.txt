3 morning, everyone.
4          (Good morning.)
5          COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE:  The
6 hour has come.  We have a quorum.  I'd
7 ask that all guests and visitors please
8 retire behind the rail.  The members have
9 taken their seat.  We're going to come to
10 order.
11          To give our invocation this
12 morning, the Chair recognizes Father John
13 Babowitch of Our Lady of Calvary Catholic
14 Church.  He is here today as the guest of
15 Councilman O'Neill.
16          I would ask all members and
17 guests and visitors to please rise.
18          (Members and guests rise.)
19          FATHER BABOWITCH:  In the name
20 of the father and of the son and of the
21 holy spirit.  Amen.
22          God is love.  In the desire to
23 make us share in this love, he sent his
24 son God into the world to come to our aid
25 and gentle kindness to help those who are

2 weak, sick or unfortunate.  It is great
3 love for all of us.  Christ said that
4 whatever you do for the least among us,
5 you do for him.  He called those who show
6 mercy blessed of his father and promised
7 them eternal life.
8          Let us pray for the Lord's
9 blessing on the members of City Council
10 who are devoted to helping their brothers
11 and sisters.  And we pray.
12          The love of Christ has gathered
13 us together to one.  Let us rejoice and
14 be glad in him.  Let us fear and love the
15 living God, and love each other from the
16 depths of our heart.  Therefore, when we
17 are together, let us take heed not to be
18 divided in mind.  Let there be an end to
19 bitterness and quarrels, an end to strife
20 and, in the midst, be Christ our God.
21 And in the company with the blessed, may
22 we see your face in glory, Christ our
23 God, pure and abounding joy, forever and
24 forever.
25          Amen.

3          FATHER BABOWITCH:  Let us pray.
4          Blessed are you, Lord God of
5 mercy, who through your son gave us a
6 marvelous example of charity and the
7 great commandment of love for one
8 another.  Send down your blessings on
9 these, your servants.  Help them to do
10 the work so beautiful for Philadelphia.
11          We ask to bless our Council, to
12 strengthen them in all their
13 deliberations.  When they are called on
14 in times of need, let them faithfully
15 serve you and their neighbor.
16          We ask this through Christ our
17 Lord.
18          Amen.
19          (Amen.)
20          FATHER BABOWITCH:  And may

16 really appreciate you taking time out of

2 Business Enterprise Development Week.
3 Would Angela Dowd-Burton and those
4 accompanying her please join the
5 Councilman at the podium.
6          And joining Councilman Jones we
7 have Councilwoman Quinones-Sanchez and
8 Councilman Oh and Councilman Neilson and
9 Councilwoman Blackwell.
10          COUNCILMAN JONES:  Incredibly,
11 today we stand to recognize the 30th
12 annual celebration of the Philadelphia
13 Minority Enterprise Development Week here
14 in Philadelphia.  The theme this year is
15 Breakthroughs Through Innovation.  And I
16 guess we could not talk about inclusion,
17 affirmative action in contracting nor
18 employment without mentioning three
19 names.  The first one is the late great
20 Lucien Blackwell.
21          COUNCILWOMAN BLACKWELL:  Thank
22 you.
23          COUNCILMAN JONES:  The second
24 name is W. Wilson Goode, our former
25 Mayor.  And the third was an
(215) 504-4622
Strehlow & Associates, Inc.
9
1   9/25/14 - STATED - PRESENTATIONS
2 administrator that no one heard of before
3 17-500.  His name was John Macklin.  And
4 what he did was to look at the data that
5 was produced by the various purchasing
6 departments and he discovered that less
7 than one half of a percent --
8          COUNCILWOMAN BLACKWELL:  Less
9 than one-tenth of one percent.
10          COUNCILMAN JONES:  Excuse me.
11 I stand corrected.  Less than one-tenth
12 of one percent was found to have gone to
13 African American, other minorities, and
14 women-owned businesses in the City of
15 Philadelphia's purchasing process.  And
16 these three individuals got together,
17 working with Council, to create
18 legislation that changed things, and it's
19 17-500.  It evolved to today's OEO, but I
20 can stand here today and say that we have
21 achieved 28 percent DBE participation in
22 the City of Philadelphia.  And, no, it's
23 not perfect, but it's sure better than
24 what it used to be.  And you can clap to
25 that.

3          COUNCILMAN JONES:  So we
4 present this resolution supporting the
5 National Minority Business Development
6 Agency and recognizing the 30th
7 Anniversary of Philadelphia's Minority
8 Enterprise Development Week, from the
9 29th of September through the 4th of
10 October 2014, for providing critical
11 information, fostering growth and
12 competitiveness for minority business in
13 the community and in Philadelphia; and
14          COUNCILWOMAN BROWN:  Whereas,
15 since 1983, the United States President
16 has proclaimed a National Minority
17 Enterprise Development Week observance to
18 recognize the outstanding achievements of
19 Minority Business Enterprises and to
20 honor those corporations and financial
21 institutions that support minority
22 business development.  Annual regional
23 conferences and activities are organized
24 by the United States Department of
25 Commerce's Minority Business Development
(215) 504-4622

2 Agency in collaboration with the United
3 States Small Business Administration's
4 Office of Government Contracting and
5 Business Development; and
6          COUNCILMAN OH:  Whereas, the
7 MED Week celebration was started locally
8 in Philadelphia in 1984 to honor and
9 promote minority owned businesses in the
10 Philadelphia area.  The organizers of the
11 first MED Week activities were Barbara
12 Daniel Cox, former Director of Mayor
13 Wilson Goode's Women's Commission, and
14 Bilal Abdul Qayyum, Assistant to the
15 Deputy Director of the City Commerce
16 Department; and
17          COUNCILMAN NEILSON:  And
18 whereas, the 30th Anniversary of MED Week
19 is chaired by the African-American
20 Chamber of Commerce of PA, New Jersey and
21 Delaware, The Asian American Chamber of
22 Commerce of Greater Philadelphia, The
23 City of Philadelphia Commerce Department,

2 Development Agency.  For one week,
3 business leaders from across the region
4 will host various workshops focused
5 around this year's theme, Breakthrough:
6 Growth and Innovation;
7          COUNCILMAN JOHNSON:  Whereas,
8 the 2014 MED Week celebration marks a
9 major milestone for the minority business
10 community.  While progress has been made,
11 continuous efforts are needed around
12 minority business development.  A recent
13 study released by ENGAGE, a student-run
14 think tank at the University of
15 Pennsylvania, indicated that a shift in
16 growing industries required more
17 highly-skilled, college educated workers,
18 which is not characterized by many
19 Philadelphia minorities.  This is one of
20 the major initiatives that the
21 African-American Chamber of Commerce and
22 other business leaders is looking into
23 changing in the coming year;
24          COUNCILWOMAN SANCHEZ:  Whereas,
25 Philadelphia is home to so many creative,
(215) 504-4622

13
1   9/25/14 - STATED - PRESENTATIONS
2 hard-working entrepreneurs.  Our economy
3 is experiencing rapid growth.  Buildings
4 are being erected and renovated,
5 healthcare is expanding, and our
6 financial system is stable and the stock
7 market indexes are at an all-time high.
8 Philadelphia is ranked third in
9 construction growth across the United
10 States of America.  Hospitality and
11 tourism are on the rise, along with the
12 expansion of bridges, highways, ports,
13 rail system, and the airport here in
14 Philadelphia.  MED Week is an opportunity
15 for these local businesses to learn,
16 grow, and connect the dots that will take
17 their companies to the next level;
18          COUNCILWOMAN BLACKWELL:  And
19 whereas, the 2014 Philly MED Week will
20 kick-off with the 2014 MED Week Award
21 Reception, which takes place on Monday,
22 September 29th, 8:00 a.m. in the Mayor's
23 Reception Room downstairs in City Hall.
24          COUNCILWOMAN BROWN:  Be it
25 resolved, by the Council of the City of
(215) 504-4622
Strehlow & Associates, Inc.
14

6 Philadelphia Minority Enterprise
7 Development Week which provides critical
8 information, resources, opportunities,
9 and inspiration to foster the trajectory
10 for growth and sustainability in the
11 minority business development community.
12          Further resolved, that an
13 engrossed copy of this resolution be

16 support and sincere sentiments of this
17 legislative body.

14 appreciate that.
15          The members of the co-chairing
16 committee have been noted.  I want to
17 repeat them, because it is clear that
18 over the last couple of years we've begun
19 to collaborate in new and creative ways,
20 and we want to make sure that we are
21 connecting the dots as major advocates
22 for minorities in this business

4 for the whole week of over 20 events.
5          This year, yes, the theme is
6 Growth Through Innovation, and as we
7 celebrate our business community, we
8 acknowledge the contribution of our
9 legislators in helping to
10 institutionalize structure of support and
11 accountability for minority, women, and
12 disabled-owned business enterprises.  We
13 also honor a man who tipped the scales 31
14 years ago when he commissioned a study to
15 measure the disparity, economic
16 disparity, within our business community.
17 Managing Director W. Wilson Goode and
18 subsequently Mayor Goode exemplified the
19 vision and leadership that launched a sea
20 change in the growth and development of
21 minority and women-owned businesses.
22 Mayor Goode's Administration and this
23 City Council mobilized the resources of
24 the City to champion the inclusion of

3 and prosperity of those enterprises that
4 were ready, willing, and able to accept
5 the challenge.
6          In recognition of the 30th
7 Anniversary of the Philadelphia Minority
8 Enterprise Development Week, we
9 acknowledge the contributions of Mayor W.
10 Wilson Goode, of Mayor Michael Nutter,
11 and this City of Philadelphia City
12 Council.  We acknowledge by celebrating
13 the successes of our business community
14 and showcasing best practices for those
15 who are still on the path to success by
16 improving access to resources and
17 contracting opportunities in the local
18 and global marketplace, and next week we
19 will be talking about millions of dollars
20 in contracts with and outside of City
21 government, and, finally, by raising our
22 collective commitment and vigilance in
23 the measure of our impact as advocates
24 for the minority business community and

2          The 2014 MED Week celebration

4 resources, business relationships, and
5 contracting opportunities.  Programs

7 the Navy Yard, from the Greater
8 Philadelphia Chamber to the Federal
9 Reserve Bank, from The Enterprise Center
10 to the Barnes Museum, and to the Water
11 Department Fox Street headquarters and so
12 much more.
13          So as you can see, leaders
14 within the public, private, and
15 non-profit sectors have accepted the call
16 to action.  In the future, we hope
17 business owners reflect on 2014 as the
18 year they began to fully appreciate the
19 power of innovation, of networking, and
20 navigating the business process.  Their
21 collaboration and commitment to
22 excellence is the key to building the

4 We have a lot planned and it's not going

6 and citizens of this city to come out and
7 support MED Week.  We're excited about
8 celebrating 30 years.  We're excited
9 about the support we're getting from the
10 City Council, but in order for it to be
11 successful, we need all the citizens to
12 take advantage of these resource.

2 Most of you don't know him, but John was
3 a person that worked in City Hall.  He
4 worked on all our sound systems in the
5 Chamber, in the caucus, and assisted

7 the events.  It was an untimely passing.
8 I'd just ask for a moment of silence
9 briefly.

10 Councilman Oh and I are co-venturing on a

7          COUNCILWOMAN BROWN:  Thank you,

9 Councilman Oh's exciting talent venture,
10 I'm going to make a public appeal that
11 next year when you do this, you will
12 include different genres of dance so that
13 that performing arts as well can be
14 celebrated.
15          I have two announcements.  In
16 2010, Mr. President, my office and I took
17 a closer look at the disposal of
18 prescription drugs, and the reason why we
19 did this was our discovery that every
20 year 2.1 million children ages 12 to 17
21 report prescription drug abuse.  Further,
22 we learned that in 24 metropolitan
23 cities, including Philadelphia when our
24 water was tested, drinking water, 56
25 different pharmaceuticals were found in
(215) 504-4622
Strehlow & Associates, Inc.
62
1      9/25/14 - STATED - SPEECHES
2 our testing water.  And so the good news
3 is that Councilman Denny O'Brien joined
4 us and raised the bar on this again, and
5 as a partner with him, we want to remind
6 our listeners and our viewers that this
7 Saturday, September 27th, from 10:00 a.m.
8 to 2:00 p.m. is National Drug Abuse
9 Disposal Prescription Day, and we're
10 asking everyone and, most notably parents
11 who have children, that they seek to
12 dispose drugs in a way that's proper and
13 correct.
14          And then, secondly, in keeping
15 with MED Week, for the sixth consecutive
16 year my office will be joining with PIDC
17 to bring together about three dozen small
18 business people down at the Navy
19 Shipyard, which still offers enormous
20 opportunity, and we'll be giving a
21 full-panel presentation followed by a
22 tour of that fabulous economic engine
23 down there.
24          Thank you, Mr. President.

2 Thank you, Councilwoman.
3          And the Chair recognizes
4 Councilwoman Quinones-Sanchez.
5          COUNCILWOMAN SANCHEZ:  Thank
6 you, Mr. President.  Later this afternoon
7 the Special Commission established by the
8 Mayor will be publicly releasing a
9 report.  There's been already much
10 discussion about this.  I personally want
11 to thank all the members of the
12 Commission who represented both from the
13 academic world, the building trades, and
14 the contractors for spending countless
15 hours in the discussion about how do we
16 improve the public safety of the City of
17 Philadelphia.
18          The report has many items that
19 are synergetic to what the task force,
20 led by this Council, established by you,
21 Council President, discussed and provides
22 some insights on some potential other
23 ideas and national best practices.  I
24 look forward to working with the
25 Administration and my Council colleagues
(215) 504-4622
Strehlow & Associates, Inc.
64
1      9/25/14 - STATED - SPEECHES
2 to provide a full briefing.  Many Council
3 folks post the task force, our City
4 Council task force, has been working on
5 many issues, Councilman O'Brien and
6 Councilman Henon, and some of the
7 Commission reports will support some of
8 the work that's been ongoing and will
9 highlight others.  The most important
10 piece is that this Council in the last
11 budget cycle recognized that ultimately
12 it is about priorities and resources, and
13 I believe that the additional resources
14 given to L&I have allowed the
15 Commissioner to establish some reforms
16 that have also led to much progress.  Can
17 more be done?  Absolutely.  I think that
18 this report and the work that's been done
19 by this Council will continue to keep in
20 the forefront the enormous task that we
21 have in terms of the public safety as it
22 relates to construction sites.
23          So today's report and
24 recommendations will be well received,
25 and I look forward to a process that we
(215) 504-4622

2 can discuss them, dialogue them, and
