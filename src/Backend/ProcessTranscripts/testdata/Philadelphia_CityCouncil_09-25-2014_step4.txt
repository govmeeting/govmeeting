    Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    Good
morning, everyone.
    (Good morning.)
    Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    The
hour has come.  We have a quorum.  I'd
ask that all guests and visitors please
retire behind the rail.  The members have
taken their seat.  We're going to come to
order.
    To give our invocation this
morning, the Chair recognizes Father John
Babowitch of Our Lady of Calvary Catholic
Church.  He is here today as the guest of
Councilman O'Neill.
    I would ask all members and
guests and visitors to please rise.
    (Members and guests rise.)
    Speaker: FATHER BABOWITCH
    In the name
of the father and of the son and of the
holy spirit.  Amen.
    God is love.  In the desire to
make us share in this love, he sent his
son God into the world to come to our aid
and gentle kindness to help those who are



    Section: INVOCATION

weak, sick or unfortunate.  It is great
love for all of us.  Christ said that
whatever you do for the least among us,
you do for him.  He called those who show
mercy blessed of his father and promised
them eternal life.
    Let us pray for the Lord's
blessing on the members of City Council
who are devoted to helping their brothers
and sisters.  And we pray.
    The love of Christ has gathered
us together to one.  Let us rejoice and
be glad in him.  Let us fear and love the
living God, and love each other from the
depths of our heart.  Therefore, when we
are together, let us take heed not to be
divided in mind.  Let there be an end to
bitterness and quarrels, an end to strife
and, in the midst, be Christ our God.
And in the company with the blessed, may
we see your face in glory, Christ our
God, pure and abounding joy, forever and
forever.
    Amen.



    Section: INVOCATION

    (Amen.)
    Speaker: FATHER BABOWITCH
    Let us pray.
    Blessed are you, Lord God of
mercy, who through your son gave us a
marvelous example of charity and the
great commandment of love for one
another.  Send down your blessings on
these, your servants.  Help them to do
the work so beautiful for Philadelphia.
    We ask to bless our Council, to
strengthen them in all their
deliberations.  When they are called on
in times of need, let them faithfully
serve you and their neighbor.
    We ask this through Christ our
Lord.
    Amen.
    (Amen.)
    Speaker: FATHER BABOWITCH
    And may
almighty God bless you all, the father,
the son, and the holy spirit.
    Amen.
    (Amen.)
    Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE

    Speaker: COUNCILMAN JONES

    Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE

really appreciate you taking time out of
your day to come down and give us a
visit.  We hope that your experience

thank you very much.
    At this time, the Chair
recognizes Councilman Jones, who will
present a resolution recognizing the 30th
Anniversary of Philadelphia Minority



    Section: PRESENTATIONS

Business Enterprise Development Week.
Would Angela Dowd-Burton and those
accompanying her please join the
Councilman at the podium.
    And joining Councilman Jones we
have Councilwoman Quinones-Sanchez and
Councilman Oh and Councilman Neilson and
Councilwoman Blackwell.
    Speaker: COUNCILMAN JONES
    Incredibly,
today we stand to recognize the 30th
annual celebration of the Philadelphia
Minority Enterprise Development Week here
in Philadelphia.  The theme this year is
Breakthroughs Through Innovation.  And I
guess we could not talk about inclusion,
affirmative action in contracting nor
employment without mentioning three
names.  The first one is the late great
Lucien Blackwell.
    Speaker: COUNCILWOMAN BLACKWELL
    Thank
you.
    Speaker: COUNCILMAN JONES
    The second
name is W. Wilson Goode, our former
Mayor.  And the third was an



    Section: PRESENTATIONS

administrator that no one heard of before
17-500.  His name was John Macklin.  And
what he did was to look at the data that
was produced by the various purchasing
departments and he discovered that less
than one half of a percent --
    Speaker: COUNCILWOMAN BLACKWELL
    Less
than one-tenth of one percent.
    Speaker: COUNCILMAN JONES
    Excuse me.
I stand corrected.  Less than one-tenth
of one percent was found to have gone to
African American, other minorities, and
women-owned businesses in the City of
Philadelphia's purchasing process.  And
these three individuals got together,
working with Council, to create
legislation that changed things, and it's
17-500.  It evolved to today's OEO, but I
can stand here today and say that we have
achieved 28 percent DBE participation in
the City of Philadelphia.  And, no, it's
not perfect, but it's sure better than
what it used to be.  And you can clap to
that.



    Section: PRESENTATIONS

    (Applause.)
    Speaker: COUNCILMAN JONES
    So we
present this resolution supporting the
National Minority Business Development
Agency and recognizing the 30th
Anniversary of Philadelphia's Minority
Enterprise Development Week, from the
29th of September through the 4th of
October 2014, for providing critical
information, fostering growth and
competitiveness for minority business in
the community and in Philadelphia; and
    Speaker: COUNCILWOMAN BROWN
    Whereas,
since 1983, the United States President
has proclaimed a National Minority
Enterprise Development Week observance to
recognize the outstanding achievements of
Minority Business Enterprises and to
honor those corporations and financial
institutions that support minority
business development.  Annual regional
conferences and activities are organized
by the United States Department of
Commerce's Minority Business Development



    Section: PRESENTATIONS

Agency in collaboration with the United
States Small Business Administration's
Office of Government Contracting and
Business Development; and
    Speaker: COUNCILMAN OH
    Whereas, the
MED Week celebration was started locally
in Philadelphia in 1984 to honor and
promote minority owned businesses in the
Philadelphia area.  The organizers of the
first MED Week activities were Barbara
Daniel Cox, former Director of Mayor
Wilson Goode's Women's Commission, and
Bilal Abdul Qayyum, Assistant to the
Deputy Director of the City Commerce
Department; and
    Speaker: COUNCILMAN NEILSON
    And
whereas, the 30th Anniversary of MED Week
is chaired by the African-American
Chamber of Commerce of PA, New Jersey and
Delaware, The Asian American Chamber of
Commerce of Greater Philadelphia, The
City of Philadelphia Commerce Department,
The Greater Philadelphia Hispanic Chamber
of Commerce and The Minority Business



    Section: PRESENTATIONS

Development Agency.  For one week,
business leaders from across the region
will host various workshops focused
around this year's theme, Breakthrough:
Growth and Innovation;
    Speaker: COUNCILMAN JOHNSON
    Whereas,
the 2014 MED Week celebration marks a
major milestone for the minority business
community.  While progress has been made,
continuous efforts are needed around
minority business development.  A recent
study released by ENGAGE, a student-run
think tank at the University of
Pennsylvania, indicated that a shift in
growing industries required more
highly-skilled, college educated workers,
which is not characterized by many
Philadelphia minorities.  This is one of
the major initiatives that the
African-American Chamber of Commerce and
other business leaders is looking into
changing in the coming year;
    Speaker: COUNCILWOMAN SANCHEZ
    Whereas,
Philadelphia is home to so many creative,



    Section: PRESENTATIONS

hard-working entrepreneurs.  Our economy
is experiencing rapid growth.  Buildings
are being erected and renovated,
healthcare is expanding, and our
financial system is stable and the stock
market indexes are at an all-time high.
Philadelphia is ranked third in
construction growth across the United
States of America.  Hospitality and
tourism are on the rise, along with the
expansion of bridges, highways, ports,
rail system, and the airport here in
Philadelphia.  MED Week is an opportunity
for these local businesses to learn,
grow, and connect the dots that will take
their companies to the next level;
    Speaker: COUNCILWOMAN BLACKWELL
    And
whereas, the 2014 Philly MED Week will
kick-off with the 2014 MED Week Award
Reception, which takes place on Monday,
September 29th, 8:00 a.m. in the Mayor's
Reception Room downstairs in City Hall.
    Speaker: COUNCILWOMAN BROWN
    Be it
resolved, by the Council of the City of



    Section: PRESENTATIONS

Philadelphia, that it hereby supports the
National Minority Business Development
Agency and recognizes the 29th of
September to the 4th of October, 2014, as
Philadelphia Minority Enterprise
Development Week which provides critical
information, resources, opportunities,
and inspiration to foster the trajectory
for growth and sustainability in the
minority business development community.
    Further resolved, that an
engrossed copy of this resolution be
presented to the Philadelphia MED Week
Committee as evidence of the strong
support and sincere sentiments of this
legislative body.
    Introduced by member Councilman
Curtis Jones and sponsored, supported by
all members of Philadelphia City Council.
Congratulations.
    (Applause.)
    Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    The
Chair recognizes Ms. Dowd-Burton for
remarks.



    Section: PRESENTATIONS

    Speaker: MS. DOWD-BURTON
    Thank you,
President Clarke.
    Good morning, everyone.
    (Good morning.)
    Speaker: MS. DOWD-BURTON
    And thank you
to all the members of City Council for
this wonderful, wonderful acknowledgment.
I will tell you on behalf of the 2014 MED
Week Committee that this resolution means
a great deal.  It means the consistent
support that we've had from Council over
the past 30 years, and we truly
appreciate that.
    The members of the co-chairing
committee have been noted.  I want to
repeat them, because it is clear that
over the last couple of years we've begun
to collaborate in new and creative ways,
and we want to make sure that we are
connecting the dots as major advocates
for minorities in this business
community.  So the co-chairs include the
African American Chamber of Commerce, the
Greater Philadelphia Hispanic Chamber,



    Section: PRESENTATIONS

the Asian American Chamber, the
Pennsylvania Minority Business
Development Agency, and the Philadelphia
Commerce Department, not only the Office
of Economic Opportunity but the
Philadelphia Industrial Development
Corporation as well.
    We have over 20 major sponsors
and stakeholders this year who join us in
expressing our gratitude for this
acknowledgment, and some of those major
sponsors include the University of
Pennsylvania, Drexel University, Temple
University, the Airport, the Water
Department, the Department of Human
Services, American Airlines, Saks Fifth
Avenue -- Saks Fifth Avenue.  Sorry.
Goldman Sachs.
    Certainly different.  Too much
online.  Too much online.
    And the Convention Center, just
to name a few.
    You have our programs at your
seats.  All of our sponsors are listed



    Section: PRESENTATIONS

there, and on the back of that program is
a list.  It's a conference at the Glens
for the whole week of over 20 events.
    This year, yes, the theme is
Growth Through Innovation, and as we
celebrate our business community, we
acknowledge the contribution of our
legislators in helping to
institutionalize structure of support and
accountability for minority, women, and
disabled-owned business enterprises.  We
also honor a man who tipped the scales 31
years ago when he commissioned a study to
measure the disparity, economic
disparity, within our business community.
Managing Director W. Wilson Goode and
subsequently Mayor Goode exemplified the
vision and leadership that launched a sea
change in the growth and development of
minority and women-owned businesses.
Mayor Goode's Administration and this
City Council mobilized the resources of
the City to champion the inclusion of
disadvantaged businesses on City



    Section: PRESENTATIONS

contracts, thereby ensuring the longevity
and prosperity of those enterprises that
were ready, willing, and able to accept
the challenge.
    In recognition of the 30th
Anniversary of the Philadelphia Minority
Enterprise Development Week, we
acknowledge the contributions of Mayor W.
Wilson Goode, of Mayor Michael Nutter,
and this City of Philadelphia City
Council.  We acknowledge by celebrating
the successes of our business community
and showcasing best practices for those
who are still on the path to success by
improving access to resources and
contracting opportunities in the local
and global marketplace, and next week we
will be talking about millions of dollars
in contracts with and outside of City
government, and, finally, by raising our
collective commitment and vigilance in
the measure of our impact as advocates
for the minority business community and
the communities that they serve.



    Section: PRESENTATIONS

    The 2014 MED Week celebration
includes programs that provide insight,
resources, business relationships, and
contracting opportunities.  Programs
extend from the Mayor's Reception Room to
the Navy Yard, from the Greater
Philadelphia Chamber to the Federal
Reserve Bank, from The Enterprise Center
to the Barnes Museum, and to the Water
Department Fox Street headquarters and so
much more.
    So as you can see, leaders
within the public, private, and
non-profit sectors have accepted the call
to action.  In the future, we hope
business owners reflect on 2014 as the
year they began to fully appreciate the
power of innovation, of networking, and
navigating the business process.  Their
collaboration and commitment to
excellence is the key to building the
capacity that will be required in the
expanding public, private, and non-profit
sectors.



    Section: PRESENTATIONS

    So we hope all of you will join
us on September 29th to October 4th as we
celebrate our history but, more
importantly, reaffirm our commitment to
building businesses and putting people to
work.
    And I want to give a special
thank you to Mayor Nutter and also to the
President of City Council, President
Darrell Clarke, to Councilwoman Blondell
Reynolds Brown, Councilman Jones, and
Councilman Oh, who will personally
participate in MED Week this year.  We do
hope to see all of you.
    At this time, I'd like to
introduce Steven Scott Bradley, who is
the CEO of the African American Chamber,
for brief remarks.  Thank you again.
    Speaker: MR. BRADLEY
    Good morning,
everyone.
    (Good morning.)
    Speaker: MR. BRADLEY
    On behalf of the
committee, I just want to stand here and
thank President Clarke for acknowledging



    Section: PRESENTATIONS

us, and I just want to encourage
everybody to talk to your constituents.
We have a lot planned and it's not going
to be a success unless we get residents
and citizens of this city to come out and
support MED Week.  We're excited about
celebrating 30 years.  We're excited
about the support we're getting from the
City Council, but in order for it to be
successful, we need all the citizens to
take advantage of these resource.
    Again, thank you and have a
good day.
    Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    
Thank you.
    (Applause.)
    Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    
Council will be at ease.
    (Council at ease.)
    Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    
Thank you very much.  That concludes our
presentations.  Before we move to
communications, I would ask that we have
a moment of silence for John P. McNally.



    Section: COMMUNICATIONS

Most of you don't know him, but John was
a person that worked in City Hall.  He
worked on all our sound systems in the
Chamber, in the caucus, and assisted
pretty much every Councilmember on all of
the events.  It was an untimely passing.
I'd just ask for a moment of silence
briefly.
    (Moment of silence.)
    Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    
Thank you.
    The next order of business is

whether they are a professional musician
or someone who is just hoping to be a
musician one day, you have until next
week, September 30th, to submit on our
website, www.phllive.org, your music
video.  It can be simply something you



    Section: SPEECHES

record yourself on your cell phone, but
you can win $1,000, perform in front of
6,000 people, thanks to the Dell Music
Center, free studio recording time and
other prizes.  So please don't miss this
opportunity.  It's all about the creative
economy in Philadelphia.
    Thank you.
    Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    
Thank you, Councilman.  I refuse to
respond to that, sir.  I had something
really funny to say, but I'm not going to

    The Chair recognizes -- any
speeches on the part of the majority?
    And the Chair recognizes
Councilman Jones.
    Speaker: COUNCILMAN JONES
    Thank you,
Mr. President.  Very quickly, two
announcements.  One, tonight we will be
honoring the new President-elect of the
American Bar Association, Paulette Brown.
It will be in Conversation Hall tonight



    Section: SPEECHES

between 5:30 and 7:30 p.m.  Many
Councilmembers will be joining us.  This
is a big thing and a first for the Bar
Association.
    The second announcement is that
many members of Council will be
participating in MED Week in various
workshops, including yourself, but
Councilman Oh and I are co-venturing on a
not red state, not blue state but a green
state of inclusion for all companies.
He's been all around the world and now
he's back, and we will be dealing with
the opportunities at the Commonwealth
level for small businesses.  The title of
the workshop is the Commonwealth As Your
Partner, and we will be on Tuesday,
September 30th, 6 o'clock at the Greater
Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce, 200
South Broad Street, 7th floor, and we
would like all to come out to hear about
what opportunities are available and what
opportunities are proposed at the state
level.



    Section: SPEECHES

    Thank you, Mr. President.
    Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    
Thank you very much, Councilman.
    The Chair recognizes
Councilwoman Reynolds Brown.
    Speaker: COUNCILWOMAN BROWN
    Thank you,
Mr. President.  As a followup to
Councilman Oh's exciting talent venture,
I'm going to make a public appeal that
next year when you do this, you will
include different genres of dance so that
that performing arts as well can be
celebrated.
    I have two announcements.  In
2010, Mr. President, my office and I took
a closer look at the disposal of
prescription drugs, and the reason why we
did this was our discovery that every
year 2.1 million children ages 12 to 17
report prescription drug abuse.  Further,
we learned that in 24 metropolitan
cities, including Philadelphia when our
water was tested, drinking water, 56
different pharmaceuticals were found in



    Section: SPEECHES

our testing water.  And so the good news
is that Councilman Denny O'Brien joined
us and raised the bar on this again, and
as a partner with him, we want to remind
our listeners and our viewers that this
Saturday, September 27th, from 10:00 a.m.
to 2:00 p.m. is National Drug Abuse
Disposal Prescription Day, and we're
asking everyone and, most notably parents
who have children, that they seek to
dispose drugs in a way that's proper and
correct.
    And then, secondly, in keeping
with MED Week, for the sixth consecutive
year my office will be joining with PIDC
to bring together about three dozen small
business people down at the Navy
Shipyard, which still offers enormous
opportunity, and we'll be giving a
full-panel presentation followed by a
tour of that fabulous economic engine
down there.
    Thank you, Mr. President.
    Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    



    Section: SPEECHES

Thank you, Councilwoman.
    And the Chair recognizes
Councilwoman Quinones-Sanchez.
    Speaker: COUNCILWOMAN SANCHEZ
    Thank
you, Mr. President.  Later this afternoon
the Special Commission established by the
Mayor will be publicly releasing a
report.  There's been already much
discussion about this.  I personally want
to thank all the members of the
Commission who represented both from the
academic world, the building trades, and
the contractors for spending countless
hours in the discussion about how do we
improve the public safety of the City of
Philadelphia.
    The report has many items that
are synergetic to what the task force,
led by this Council, established by you,
Council President, discussed and provides
some insights on some potential other
ideas and national best practices.  I
look forward to working with the
Administration and my Council colleagues



    Section: SPEECHES

to provide a full briefing.  Many Council
folks post the task force, our City
Council task force, has been working on
many issues, Councilman O'Brien and
Councilman Henon, and some of the
Commission reports will support some of
the work that's been ongoing and will
highlight others.  The most important
piece is that this Council in the last
budget cycle recognized that ultimately
it is about priorities and resources, and
I believe that the additional resources
given to L&I have allowed the
Commissioner to establish some reforms
that have also led to much progress.  Can
more be done?  Absolutely.  I think that

have in terms of the public safety as it
relates to construction sites.
    So today's report and
recommendations will be well received,
and I look forward to a process that we
