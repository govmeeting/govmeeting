    <h1> Govmeeting  - Software to increase involvement in government meetings </h1>
<p>

This will eventually become the home page for the software being developed at:
 <a href="http://github.com/govmeeting/govmeeting">github.com/govmeeting/govmeeting</a><br>

Eventually the home page will contain (among other things): 
<ul>
<li> A search box and directory of towns/cities who are participating  </li>
<li> A listing of the meetings in the database.  </li>
<li> An area highlighting new particpants  </li>
<li> An area highlighting active community volunteers  </li>
</ul>

  <br><br>

The <a href="meeting">Meeting </a> tab above shows the start of a program for displaying a meeting transcript. <br>
The transcript is from a selectmen's meeting in a small town in Maine. <br>
A user can click on a topic to only see only what was said on that topic. Or they can click on a name to see only what that person said. <br>
Right now we don't yet show the context surroundng what the selected person said. <br> <br>

The <a href="addtags">Add Tags </a> tab above shows the start of a program that a community volunteer will use to process a transcript. <br>
To make transcripts more useful, meaningful topic and section names need to be assigned to the parts of the meeting. <br>
This sample transcript is of a Philadelphia City Council meeting. <br> <br>
