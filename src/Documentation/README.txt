GovmeetingServer.shfbproj - A Sandcastle project that was created with Sandcastle Help File Builder (SHFB).
[ This project was working a while ago, but now causes VS to generate many errors. I added ".TXT" to the
end of the project name to avoid the errors for now until it is fixed. ]
 It produces a documentation website in the .\documentation\Help folder. View this by opening index.html.
 Re-create the documentation by opening this project file with the SHFB GUI and running "build".
 Eventually, this step will be added as part of an automatic build process.
