He spoke often of your relationship to him and of course to the Blackwell family.\n         Just a couple of very brief comments.  The first is that the dictionary has a lot of words for dignity:  courage, strength, moral words having to do with character and so forth, but for Thomas Wilson Stearly Logan and Hermione Clark Hill-Logan, dignity is to be found in the word of God.  They would ask you, among other places, to turn to March 17, 2016 Matthew 5 where the Sermon on the Mount speaks to all of the homeless in our time and in theirs about those who mourn, those who seek righteousness and who are thirsty for justice.  So their definition of dignity is to be found in the word of God, but there is another aspect to all of this that we can all share in.  Thomas and Hermione Logan were part of a long, distinguished Philadelphia clergy and partnership that goes back to Bishop Richard Allen and his wife Sarah, to the Reverend Absalom Jones and his wife Mary, to the very Reverend Father Paul Washington and his wife Christine, and then to the Reverend Leon Sullivan and his wife Grace.  These were all pastors, partners, and public servants who worked their entire lives to make Philadelphia, our nation, our state, and our world a better place.  They would all end by saying \"the glory is to God.\"\n         Thank you.\n         (Applause.) March 17, 2016\n",

      "said": "    Good morning. Jeffrey Braff for the Center City Residents Association.  We are a civic association of approximately 1,000 households.  We cover the area between Broad Street and the Schuylkill River and between South and JFK.\n         In a logical world, March 17, 2016 Philadelphia would not need the approval of Harrisburg to utilize different real estate tax rates for commercial and residential properties.  However, we live in a world where to implement such a differential, we need an amendment to the state Constitution, and such an amendment must pass two sessions of the Pennsylvania General Assembly and win the approval of the electorate in a general election.\n         Press accounts suggest that a substantial majority in the Legislature have an anti-Philadelphia bias -- big surprise -- and are against raising taxes.  Putting the two together; in other words, giving Philadelphia the right to raise taxes, is a toxic mixture, generally doomed to failure.  Indeed, as recognized in the 5th and 6th \"whereas\" clauses of Resolution 160157, the General Assembly rejected such an effort in the fall of 2012, and Councilmember Parker has intimate familiarity with those March 17, 2016 difficulties in connection with remediation efforts involving AVI.\n         As a philosophical matter, CCRA does not disagree that it would be better, as the resolution states, to have a constitutional amendment that does not restrict the City's flexibility. However, as a matter of public policy, CCRA agrees with the constitutional amendment being advanced by the Jobs Growth Coalition.\n         More specifically, CCRA believes that the implementation of such an amendment would stimulate City employment in a thoughtful way that would not reduce City tax revenues. Furthermore, given the political realities, CCRA believes that a constitutional amendment that simply gave the City the right to have a residential and commercial real estate tax differential, without requiring a commensurate decrease in wages and business taxes, would not get past even a March 17, 2016 single session of the General Assembly. And just as importantly, passage of Resolution 160157 would be used as ammunition by anti-Philadelphia tax forces to thwart the proposed amendment. I urge you to reject the resolution.\n         Thank you.\n",

Although I am not a beneficiary of LOOP, I speak today in support of Bill 160012, as amended, which extends the time that current participants can remain in the program beyond its current end date of 2023.\n         This bill has no fiscal impact March 17, 2016 on the City budget until Fiscal Year 2024.  At that time, I estimate the foregone revenue to be less than $10 million.\n         People may ask, Why is it necessary to extend LOOP now?  Why can't we wait until the program is closer to its end date?  The answer is simple. Extension will now give peace of mind to current program beneficiaries.\n         I've spoken with current program participants who have done the arithmetic and have already determined that they will not be able to remain in their homes unless the program is extended.  Many of these people are currently retired or plan to retire by 2023, although they do not qualify for the Senior Citizen Tax Freeze.  They are unable to absorb a tax increase of $3,000 or more, which many of them will experience without passage of the bill.\n         While I support passage of this bill today, I want to speak briefly about March 17, 2016 the income limit in the bill.  The current income limit is $95,050 for a family of two.  Under this bill, the income limit for Fiscal Year 2024 would drop to $64,000, even allowing for eight years of inflation.  I personally believe that this limit is too low.  If this limit is implemented, my analysis shows that over 2,000 property owners would pay more than 10 percent of their income in property taxes.\n         I urge the Council to review this limit as more analysis becomes available, and I am able to assist in completing this analysis.\n         Thank you.\n",

And the problem I have with it is that when I read the bill and it gives me a number, then it says under the guidelines of CFR Subsection 5, or whatever it says, and I don't know where to go to find it, I'm like scared because it says low income. When I think of low income, I think of the poverty level.  So I was really frightened that it had already excluded me.\n         That's all.  That's my comment for today.  Thank you.\n",

I'm the President of GEAR, a civic group in South Philadelphia, the Girard Estate Area.  We're an RCO and have been a community group since 1982. It's an area with many seniors and longtime residents.  We were killed by AVI and the ridiculous process of reassessing properties.  There are properties assessed at 300,000 while the property next -- the exact property next door is assessed at 230,000, with more work done on it than the higher taxed one.  Also being killed by the practice of L&I handing out licenses for unwanted businesses and other atrocities like they were free movies tickets.\n         Our seniors and longtime residents deserve more than this.  We try March 17, 2016 to keep our community clean and safe.  We try to maintain our homes and their value.  However, the lure of the ten-year tax abatement to the south of our community has taken many of our residents instead of bringing in first-time homeowners and those moving back from outside the City.  These loyal people and loyal homeowners in our area need something to make them feel that their loyalty to this city and the longevity they've been here meant something.  They need to know that as unwanted businesses pop up and their property values plunge, they won't be hit with yet another tax increase while their income remains stagnant.\n         I ask you to vote to not only keep the LOOP exemption, but make it permanent for those who qualify.  I would even like to see the income level for LOOP be raised as prices for food, clothing and other necessities rise.\n         Thank you so much, and I want March 17, 2016 to thank Councilman Kenyatta Johnson and Mark Squilla for sponsoring the bill.\n",

Today with the leadership of Councilman Domb and our colleagues on Council, we're introducing legislation to hold hearings on the issue of youth homelessness in Philadelphia.\n         Youth homelessness is a major crisis in the City that goes largely under the radar.  Many of us on Council and one of the first acts of the Children and Youth and the Housing and Homelessness Committee took part in the March 17, 2016 Page 106 homeless count and focused particularly on the needs of our youth.\n         Here in Philadelphia, our state has seen an increase of 18 percent in the rise in youth homelessness since the beginning of the recession, more than double the national average.  And from 2009 to 2013, the percentage of Philadelphia public school students who experience homelessness has risen by over 70 percent.  But while these numbers are growing, the services have failed to keep pace.  The Philadelphia Office of Supportive Housing has only 4,000 emergency shelter beds, only 70 of which are devoted specifically for youth.\n         In meeting with a number of service providers, the impact of homelessness on our children has had devastating impacts on their development and success, and like most social ills, it disproportionately impacts low-income, minority, LBGTQ youth, and at-risk children. March 17, 2016 Page 107\n         More than 40 percent of youth who age out of the child welfare system end up homeless by age 18, and more than half of homeless youth self-identify as LGBTQ.  There is only one crisis shelter in the entire City of Philadelphia, Covenant House, that exclusively serves young adults, and they spoke of an 18-year-old young woman who was eight months pregnant that came to their door for help but had to be turned away.  And as a body, we know that we have an obligation to make sure that not one more young person is turned away from the basic right to housing in this city.  We look forward to these hearings and in partnership with you.\n         Thank you very much.\n",

This week we March 17, 2016 Page 116 concluded a series of education town halls across the City that drew out hundreds of people talking about what it means to focus in on our young people and services that they need desperately in schools.  Among the most serious issues that we have been highlighting in City Council has been the issue of teacher vacancies, which is a stunning situation in which hundreds of classrooms and thousands of children are left without a teacher.  At one of the town halls, we heard of a 12th grader who has had two English teachers since September, lost their second English teacher in November and has not had an English teacher since. In fact, the principal sometimes substitutes and comes in to lead a 12th grade English class.  These are essential services.\n         It is also encouraging at the same time that last night the District announced that they will hire 800 new jobs for teachers.  These are great jobs March 17, 2016 Page 117 in this city, and they have to be upheld. And we congratulate the District for taking a proactive role.  Councilwoman Blackwell, myself, my colleagues on Council who have hosted these folks who have come to the town halls know how essential this issue to push and push the District towards the essential things that young people need.\n         But I do want to add that in order for those 800 jobs to come to Philadelphia, I believe that the School District of Philadelphia needs to have a teachers contract, a teachers contract that actually invites and lures teachers to our city.  The Philadelphia teachers have been without a contract for three years, and four years if you don't include an extension that included no pay raises.  If we're going to get 800 new jobs into this city, 800 jobs serving our youth and the best jobs in the City, we need to see a teachers contract go through, and I encourage my colleagues to March 17, 2016 Page 118 communicate that to the District and to make sure that these are -- this is a good contract.\n         One quick addition as well, 75 minutes away from our city, refugee families who fled violence and unrest in their home communities are being imprisoned, including children, at the Berks County Residential Center.  We have nearly 100 immigrants and children living in dangerous conditions that have been identified by human rights organizations that are shocking to the census.\n         Last January a federal detention center worker was arrested for repeated sexual molestation of young people, including witnesses by children. A human rights attorney filed a complaint where a two-year-old girl vomiting blood was told to drink water and then sent back to her cell.\n         Substandard conditions in the shelter have led to widespread medical outbreaks, and children are being forced March 17, 2016 Page 119 to share sleeping quarters with adults they do not know and of the opposite sex.\n         It is not in our -- I want to thank Council and especially Councilwoman Maria Quinones-Sanchez, which sent a letter in November demanding the immediate shutdown of the Berks Correctional Facility.  But I think that the ramping up of this message needs to be sent more broadly.  The Governor has ordered Berks closed.  The county commissioners are currently fighting to keep it open.  If there is anything that our Council colleagues can do to communicate to the Berks County officials that this detention center that incarcerates children of a young age and has seen inordinate human rights abuses, unconscionable human rights abuses needs to be shut down.  We need to let them know that immigrant families and young people are suffering under their watch. We want them to withdraw the appeal to keep the Berks County Center open and March 17, 2016 Page 120 release those families immediately.\n         Thank you.\n",

So it's an opener to start, and it's a great way to understand how Council and the Administration can work together to get something done.\n         But my main announcement is that on Wednesday, the 23rd, next week, we're going to celebrate the 121st Anniversary of the Philly flag raising. It's going to be right outside at the March 17, 2016 Page 121 Municipal Services Building, and hopefully all Councilmembers will try to make that time to go over there.  The first city flag in the country for its 121st Anniversary will be raised on Wednesday, the 23rd at noon.\n         So thank you very much.\n",

With all the serious issues that were discussed and dealt with today, I wanted to kind of lighten it up a little bit and say that spring has sprung and March has come and March Madness has ensued.  And I want to salute all of the Philadelphia-based and regional universities that made it to the Dance.  I want to salute Villanova.  I want to salute you and Cindy's Temple University but, most importantly, I want to salute those Saint Joe's Hawks.  And March 17, 2016 Page 122 we wish you luck up until the time you meet them, and then at that point, we'd like to be victorious in the 4th with Saint Joe's University.  But it's a good time.  It highlights our city, gives us three chances to make it through those treacherous brackets.  And I think I agree with President Obama on a great many things, but not on his selection for the final four.\n         Thank you, Mr. President.\n",

I also want to just reiterate the non-privileged resolution we introduced today, which was to urge the State of Pennsylvania, the General Assembly to enact a state Earned Income Tax Credit.  Twenty-six states have this. And the poverty level in the state is 13.7; Philadelphia is 26 percent.  And I also want to challenge the media, all of our major TV stations, all of our news outlets, to publicize -- this is four weeks and counting -- for the Earned Income Tax Credit, of which last year we left $100 million that could have gone to 40,000 families.  We need the media to publicize this.  It's very important. We're down to the last four weeks.  So anything that the media can do, we'd be most appreciative.\n         Thank you.\n",
