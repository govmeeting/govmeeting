2:19
ok the next item on the agenda is sport of select member reports when do you
2:29
have anything from the economic development
2:33
well the Joint Economic Development the committee met last week we are missing a
2:43
representative from boothbay harbor and in the absence of readily available
2:52
candidate we're going to have to solicit volunteers are individuals who would
2:58
like to volunteer to join the Economic Development Committee those of
3:03
individuals have to be residents of boothbay harbor so we'll chat with Tom
3:09
about the best way to publicize that and we spend some time talking about having
3:17
a retreat for the Joint Economic Development Committee so we can have
3:21
some conversation about the longer-term perspective hope everybody and the
3:26
harbor and the viewing audience have seen the banners that are up both in the
3:30
town and over by the fire station on your way out of town that are
3:34
advertising the boothbay festival of lights
3:38
this is the complementary activity that we've been working on to really have
3:45
synergy and cross advertising for the gardens of glow and the availability in
3:52
the town of restaurants merchants lodging so that everybody has a win-win
3:58
out of the holiday event in the visitors that we expect to come for gardens and
4:03
low so the last thing that we talked about is going to be addressed later in
4:10
the agenda Bob fonts is here to talk about
4:13
the potential of applying for a grant for parking audit and so i'll defer that
4:19
to bob is this his presentation so anyway moving right along so great
4:27
anyway ? do anything to head
4:31
no just sit there is so exciting things on the on the forefront there's going to
4:35
be a meeting similar to the one that was held in the springtime to pass out more
4:41
information we don't know if that's going to be at the Opera House or not
4:45
similar to the last one but stay tuned and number of businesses have responded
4:51
that they will be open and participating and we're just looking forward to
4:55
sharing the town and the lights in the festivities and everything about the
5:00
season so very excited
5:03
yeah just just amplify that i tentatively I think the consultants that
5:08
we hire green three events are planning to be here in town on the seventh that's
5:14
a tentative date to meet again with businesses and give an update on sort of
5:19
the plans for that
5:21
boothbay winter festival of lights so we'll get information out through the
5:26
register and other means when we have definite stuff about that
5:30
okay thanks thanks thanks both of you as far as my announcement or report as you
5:39
know I am the boothbay harbor representative on the ambulance board
5:44
and at the last meeting Palmer pain asked a question about the what he
5:52
described as home healthcare and I think Palmer Palmer is here tonight and I
5:58
wanted to respond to your your question from a couple of weeks ago and I think
6:06
what you were asking was expressing some concern about why the ambulance service
6:12
is getting involved in home health care when in the past they've been struggling
6:18
financially and should they really be doing this well so
6:22
we establish all healthcare supply Lincoln hell right right so well that we
6:37
do is the answer and first of all for everybody's benefit is the what they
6:44
call with the ambulance service calls the community power medicine program
6:49
that you're talking about and I do have a brochure on that if anybody's
6:54
interested but it's a program that the ambulance service has been involved in
6:58
for about three years and they are they're all menteng the services of the
7:06
district nurse program and the district nurse is frankly stretched too far at
7:13
this point so the ambulance service has picked up some more kollam rudimentary
7:20
type healthcare issues like making sure people take their prescription
7:25
medication or stopping in to check blood pressure or I'm monitoring folks to to
7:33
make sure that they're doing what they're supposed to do
7:36
the idea being that it's it's preventative care that will avoid an
7:42
emergency situation and an ambulance call later on so they've been operating
7:49
it under grant funding to date the director Taylor grant program has been
7:58
very generous to the ambulance surface and has has funded that Scott lash the
8:06
director at the ambulance service has been using people his staff that are in
8:14
in downtime between calls frankly or if they're on their way back from a quality
8:18
and and are in the neighborhood of someone that needs attention they can
8:23
stop in a person has to be referred to the community paramedicine program by
8:30
their primary care physician so it
8:34
it's monitored manage that way and I think there are a couple of benefits in
8:40
addition to the the the people receiving care and monitoring our folks at the
8:46
ambulance service are getting experience with administering prescriptions and and
8:51
some familiarity with medical conditions so there's a double benefit their what
8:58
Scott tells me is that the state of Minnesota has realized about a 16
9:02
million dollar savings through this probe this kind of a program which they
9:08
have as well compared to if emergency services had been required so his sort
9:15
of strategy is getting involved in this early with the expectation or hope that
9:22
someday MaineCare might pick this up and and reimburse it so that's kind of a
9:32
long-winded answer what I think you were looking for a couple things like that
9:37
mentioned I you probably nervous
9:40
thanks up another welfare agency we support the total but before that none
9:46
of the year but from the town punch it correct over already shipping it on that
9:52
note thank you measure the story Taylor Foundation which I think supplied
9:58
something like 50,000 balance for this new program in the ambulance service
10:02
without one of the finest members of the town budget committee married he'll
10:09
nobody would have known about the story Taylor foundation and we SAT here and
10:15
she had practically shouted signs to be referred to get the message across to
10:20
the ambulance service and others at the door Taylor foundation even exist but
10:26
Mary deal has been sighted in any other way
10:29
unfortunately she has other demands our time if you will no longer be in the
10:34
budget that is a great block to the town close to budget correct and I wanted to
10:39
bring her name into this because it has short for sure she deserves that
10:44
recognition
10:46
yep okay thank you
10:50
next item is Julia and financial reports
11:00
here today to work out good then whenever nothing accounts payable 90210
11:32
and the bank
11:41
ok i am hoping i did call yonder alchemists are enjoying them where they
11:47
already gave and shooting sometime I got to scheduling financial shoot for one
12:00
meetings not okay good good
12:05
and eventually we'll get our graph so that will be able to see how we're doing
12:13
compared to next year last year
12:16
that's great right any questions any questions from Julia now just the class
12:22
okay thanks Julia minutes of our sep tember 12 meeting I think Kelly we've
12:34
beaten those minutes to death with comments i know and you've been you've
12:39
been great about getting all those comments incorporated so I need a motion
12:46
I'll move the minutes as amended one second okay
12:51
any discussion that wasn't present the last me
12:56
ok so all in favor of accepting the minutes from the last meeting
13:01
motion passes pants
13:05
IC licenses here do we have any licenses i don't think we ever see any license
13:11
applications all right nor am i aware of any old business that we have so on to
13:20
new business and I see all of my neighbors from west harbor pond are here
13:25
in the audience that's awesome so I think the first item under new business
13:30
is mr. Blakeslee you're going to show us some slides and commentary along with it
13:42
thank you
14:16
I'm gonna stand here next screen speak and also apologize in advance
14:24
read what i have to tell you could I ask that you stand on the other side because
14:30

14:39
turn my back
14:40
oh ok and maybe you can tell us who you are thats that's in the speech at first
14:48
like to apologize for reading first great
14:51
ok good evening my name is Mara blakeslee 226 lakeside dr let's start
14:59
upon a time here the season on behalf of the Western on Watershed Association
15:04
large percentage of them were here
15:09
thank you very much for giving us the opportunity to review for you serious
15:13
environmental problems faced by west harbor pond and bring you up-to-date on
15:17
most recent and very encouraging developments revolution around that
15:21
problem
15:23
put bluntly west harbor pod is dying biological after reviewing water quality
15:29
data for the pond dr john tech director of the main water resources research
15:34
institutes that clearly is on in trouble and led to bake the latest assessment
15:41
section leader in dps bureau water quality rode upon is no longer
15:45
functioning as a freshwater system the problems the West higher reaches depths
15:52
30 feet below the 12-foot level the water no longer contains enough
15:56
developed option oxygen to sustain a product life and I think we have the
16:01
first line
16:04
this slide shows you the oxygen measurements here of and the course
16:12
blows you can see the surface and then at the 15-foot level and down 25 foot
16:18
level you can see that there is virtually notes all docs upon these data
16:24
which are represented here graphically also represented tabular form of the
16:28
first page of your handout the backup these data is is in front of you
16:37
odd isn't prices were here this evening to list your support in our effort to
16:44
save and the next slide Leslie because of its prep work and filled instruction
16:51
west harbor pond is all done something to the infiltration of salt water which
16:56
because it's having in freshwater sells the bottom of the pond and here you can
17:01
see the crib work filled bronze gravel fill in the middle and then will this be
17:09
helpful to us later on
17:10
here's the siphon cross-section onside oceans making a of from 1880 onwards to
17:21
siphons kept on freezing saltwater before the below the 22-foot mark the
17:26
doubt siphon intake pond side the larger size was removed some time after in the
17:32
last century and in 2008 a smaller sites and began to fail in 2008 is generally
17:40
understood in this community the sightings primary function was
17:43
controlled water level on preventing upon rising too high but with this
17:49
gradual failure beginning in $MONTH 2008 site was no longer service of serving
17:55
that function and high water was increasingly causing problems in short
17:58
from residences and each fields and jeopardizing the road highway 27 for a
18:04
year and a half they had a public-works nurse disciple on coaxing to continue
18:10
operating intermittently until sometime in late nineteen elect 2009 and failed
18:17
effective
18:19
in 2011.the town and DOTA entered into an agreement whereby do t would lower
18:30
the threshold of small concrete dam on the west side of the larger dam and the
18:35
tablet a continuing responsibility for work regulating water levels through the
18:40
use of the gate globe awards the pond association that had begun conducting
18:46
systematic surface water cast upon in 2008 2013 we expanded our testing
18:53
protocol to include sampling entire water
18:56
what we discovered wasn't salt water layer there always exists the very
19:01
bottom below the global level to the intake and expand with a 22 foot level 2
19:11
13 foot level replacing displacing you'll have fresh water in the pond
19:17
because of salt water layer crafted the bottom of the pond is no longer agitated
19:22
by tidal motion it has become virtually entirely deoxygenated that was the first
19:27
slide we loved it and because of slope orders greater chances does not go
19:32
undergo season 16 reoxygenation typically seen inland freshwater lake
19:38
there's too much for differential between the densities was heavier
19:43
saltwater the the later freshwater top and the association also made the
19:50
connection between the failures siphon and the progressive loss life-sustaining
19:55
freshservice water
19:56
thereupon we set about seeking funds they have a slice repaired in order to
20:02
halt ponds to apply and since then that is sense since $MONTH 2013 of the
20:08
association is submitted six branch requests
20:11
including grant request earlier this year II these clothes and stream
20:15
crossing program
20:16
unfortunately first four of these requests were unsuccessful last two but
20:22
only recently are still pending in mid-2015 obtained estimates to replace
20:29
the siphon from to marine contractors properiy rockland and write out marine
20:34
boothbay harbor both estimates contemplated opening the road surface to
20:38
replace the horizontal site number and the average of the two estimates was
20:43
fifty-five thousand dollars up until this point all discussions preparing
20:49
slightly assume the necessity of opening the surface of highway 27 removing and
20:54
replacing the old siphon pipe last month
20:58
chris higgins and Sewer District suggest that we contacted 10 varying company
21:03
liberal with specialized so-called trenchless repair wonder of underground
21:09
water and sewer pipes uses various technologies to rehabilitate types from
21:16
the inside rather than removing and replacing them
21:19
this course is probably our steps toward a solution like last used a parent
21:29
company carried out preliminary photographic examination for the site
21:32
this examination would have been possible without the generous
21:36
cooperation three entities the tab through whose Director of Public Works
21:41
Chris Lehman system the examination this
21:44
when you were instrumental there thank you will also the sewer district is
21:50
providing specialized camera equipment the crude operated and maintained do tea
21:55
with center representative wallet from waterboro another one all the way from
21:59
adjust were profoundly grateful
22:02
all three for their presence and participation Leslie may I help the next
22:07
lines going to take you through of a series of slides the exterior of the
22:15
cyclist so you can visualize better what we're talking about this is the were on
22:21
the ground upon side the damn that's right where the American flag is this is
22:27
the elbow connecting well and called horizontal member which goes through the
22:31
dam and the drop pipe which goes down to the intake 22-foot level pondside this
22:40
right here we see that our next slide is a cover which apparently it's empty now
22:47
but apparently there's a valve mechanism in it but that you can see the next
22:52
slide
22:54
this is the top of that a valve chamber we look down here is a manufacturer on
22:58
it from troy new york belt manufacturing companies of in the next one please
23:04
this body is the the original cast iron of the date 1880 appears to places on
23:11
the bowl of the valve also on the cup and the actual place and hear of years
23:20
day proud of the sewer district taking off of one of the only two bolts see
23:26
their their grief about twenty four bolts around there they want
23:30
holding the color odd he's having to drive off and here is here's the cover
23:36
and then what I've been described next is how held the sewer district but its
23:43
camera in here on back here functions over there and love and did this
23:51
photographic examination so to gain access to the horizontal member of the
23:56
siphon or the break was believed to be located 1880 valve chamber of the pond
24:01
side of the dam was removed
24:02
just look at that and the third is districts camera was inserted through
24:06
the valve chamber into the horizontal member of assignment where it progress
24:10
until it came to a halt to break in the pipe 26 feet from the valve color or
24:16
just north of the centerline highway 27 mostly thank you on these slides this is
24:23
difficult to see here will be easier on the next one's this is the distance in
24:28
off the cameras on us like you go back one slide please measure apparently from
24:36
this point here and then directly across the day and what you can see here is
24:44
that there is water
24:46
this is even though even though the siphon slant slightly down from the pawn
24:50
side seaside here on the here on the pond side there's water up but only
24:57
because there's a small amount of debris here so next slide please listen
25:01
yeah here we are in the middle of this small debris field there's still water
25:06
and then the next line on beyond brief shield with the 22-foot point of this is
25:16
off this is a joint in the pipe and we're coming up on the break
25:20
next please
25:22
ok here we are at 25 and a half feet
25:27
this is the break the up the old old 19th century cast iron has broken or
25:35
cultural late i hate that word of god and the and it's been displaced birth so
25:44
sort of the odd cycles dropped off thats this gap is 23 inches i'd like to think
25:53
it's two and a half because this about
25:56
so that's the displacement and unless the last ok and here safe
26:03
close up the same pictures that you can see some of the fill material from the
26:07
damn
26:13
the inspiration what we see here is extremely graphic and it it it's very
26:19
different from what we've been led to expect fine for example site and pipe is
26:24
not crushed
26:25
moreover some to displace by no more than 2-3 inches we've been led to
26:29
believe their substantial displacement in it is not obstructed with the break
26:35
of the these these companies of working these pipes have sophisticated
26:39
mechanisms for forgetting debris out of pipes
26:46
apparently they can get boulders the size of football out they don't need to
26:50
do that this this point at least a portion we've seen is almost clean and
26:56
we don't have any we don't know you don't have any reason to believe there
27:00
are any problems on the other side the horizontal number that we were able to
27:06
see we couldn't get past that could get the camera past this break and probably
27:13
the best piece of use the temporary companies represented stated
27:17
representative stated definitively that he could repair the break that means
27:21
three different techniques
27:23
these are techniques that completely use and working performs main do key and not
27:29
involve open road bit
27:31
they're all this principle technology the most promising involves removing the
27:36
burnt ends of the siphon call on that the second slide elbows installing a
27:44
smaller piece of high-density polyethylene pipe within the existing
27:48
host pipe sliding a piece right through there for one end sticking out when
27:54
sticking out the other and routing the space between the two pipes control desk
27:59
around at present waiting for an estimate from very companies or switch
28:05
over
28:06
but its portion will be a portion repair first be necessary to obtain engineering
28:13
drawings for the repair phase in hand be necessary to see the records and
28:18
prevents from do tea and possibly from other agents indeed taking the required
28:24
permits may prove at least this challenging is obtaining the necessary
28:27
fun with permits in hand the berry company will be able to proceed with
28:32
repair or rehabilitation before Saul finally the drop pipes on the pond
28:38
harbor sides will have to be either reuse replaced and only they have the
28:44
end of that multi-stage process we have a working site again
28:48
so what about funding pod residents are prepared to put their hand in their own
28:55
pockets to contribute to the paper say that right out front and the association
29:00
also intense with funds from members of the community board together these funds
29:06
will provide tangible evidence community's commitment to the project
29:09
and conserves matching funds and future grandpa's but even the most optimistic
29:15
scenario that seems unlikely the private contributions will be able to fund the
29:20
entire cost of repair
29:21
thus Association intends to ask ask the various agencies and public entities
29:27
that have a responsibility for some aspect of west hartford conn for systems
29:32
and bringing this project successful conclusion of the state level
29:37
these include deokee dep bring resources department officials at the local level
29:44
include water district sewer district and naturally
29:50
carp carp sorry impact that's that that's a dangerous mistake of the
30:00
assistants the state local and just blend these take many partial funding
30:04
provisions materials provision of expertise particularly engineering
30:09
expert and use the personnel containing products from the very beginning I mean
30:17
from very beginning of the Damned the tabs active partner in the west harbor
30:22
problem and it's down the side making 79 the talented to pay them a nice company
30:28
the handsome sum of two hundred dollars per year for ten years to ensure that
30:32
the ice company would install and maintain a road over the dam for the use
30:36
of the town's residents and this pledge undoubtedly represent this difficult
30:40
part of the money to require work on the game more recently we've seen the town
30:45
maintaining the threshold the culprits control rods water level we're going to
30:51
keep the siphon operator and the town is responsible one of the most significant
30:55
contributions the waterfall to the pond when connected the beach Cove hotel and
31:00
multi-unit housing along the southeastern shore the town sewage
31:04
treatment plant this evening we're here to ask for your morals and save in west
31:10
harbor park shortly we will be back as for your materials
31:15
let me be clear we're not asking you to fix the size and we are asking you to do
31:21
is work alongside lost other agencies and individuals and collective public
31:27
and private debt to society
31:29
thank you very much
31:31
we have taken questions thank you
31:39
and while you're thinking your questions just call attention to hand out like a
31:44
first page is oxygen levels second stuff chemistry first of all thank you for a
32:00
very clear presentation and really laying out all the hard work the
32:05
associations done i complement all of you on your persistence and your
32:09
optimism to get the sun's very exciting actually one of the nicest presentations
32:15
I think we've had the select board meeting a long time you know I'm just
32:19
curious because i know one of the things that at least I've heard MDOT say is oh
32:26
we didn't want to do anything because what if the dam would give way and then
32:30
west harbor pond would flow into the ocean and we would replace this once
32:35
again and i'm trying to remember what town that happened to wear the damn gave
32:41
way and yes and i'm just interested
32:46
do you have any information to what happened to property value assessments
32:50
on sure like when the water drained out from the light because in my mind one of
32:56
the things that we as town officials should think about is certainly if your
33:02
property values are retained that certainly is good for us from a tax
33:08
basis of westheimer pond becomes either dead pond or drained pond
33:14
I think property valuations would be affected which would have a secondary
33:18
effect on property tax revenue for the town so I do feel there's a vested
33:24
interest in the town of helping retain both the beauty and the viability of
33:30
west harbor pond from both the sort of moral standpoint but also from a
33:35
financial standpoint so I'm just wonder if you all have looked at that as a
33:39
piece of information
33:42
we have we don't have to tenant of answers but we do know is the parts of
33:49
parts of upon particularly the west side drop directly into the water and there's
33:56
there's water there that is water be below time there are other parts of on
34:03
my property and both these types of the Shelf these sides is particularly shell
34:09
but they're certainly shallow areas along the along the west side as well
34:15
awesome i have similar little similar codes and those of you want a boat I'd
34:21
and that would that would clearly be detrimental property so we thought about
34:28
this a lot we we we hope to get get some appraiser to give us some harder answers
34:34
but were and would you mind sharing with us the feedback that was provided on the
34:41
last rejected grant application why they did not feel it was competitive i mean
34:49
you make a very compelling case to me if I were a reviewer so I'm just wondering
34:54
what the rationale was whether the population density was too small or what
35:00
what was the issue and Bob were both part of meeting where we went to deep
35:06
right call poster board of logs
35:08
the call to debrief in are they of this was mrs. Olbermann stream crossings
35:20
project which they've been understanding a lot of money there and the the program
35:32
was designed to forward for policy and the climate resiliency habitat from Bob
35:44
you're scaring here and i'll be on yer climate resiliency of water quality club
35:55
habitat and motivating infrastructure we hit every one of those on the and we SAT
36:02
with them and was clearly proved capable people except for a sympathetic to us
36:09
but finally I said so is the problem here that a scientist not covert and
36:17
that of westerville tries on screen you when we can't we don't have a whole size
36:27
you pay it was the uses is as simple and as it's frustrating because is that
36:33
because we really thought advanced policy probably get about . so i can add
36:40
X i was at me and it
36:42
this project is caught in between and
36:45
of programs and it doesn't fly as far as DP goes DP will prove the culvert a pond
36:56
culvert under certain circumstances problems he said his is not college and
37:02
this is the only saltwater freshwater site and in the state and leave and
37:07
maybe the only one country and so this was never envisioned as being a
37:12
something that would be category under the program Department of Transportation
37:19
use federal funds these it's part of this work and in order to qualify for
37:28
federal funds there has to be a transportation aspect of traffic and
37:33
there's no transportation aspect of this problem because that site could be
37:37
because inoperable and it's doesn't affect the function of the road as a
37:42
color and then significant problem is that if for example although it doesn't
37:51
from your really pretty pictures that look like slightly if that cycle
37:57
continues to deteriorate and it causes damage to the road such that dam itself
38:04
is damaged it would be highly improbable such a similarly at Mission like having
38:14
problems with the OT would apply for
38:17
to replace it because then you have a situation where the freshwater stream
38:23
again and to DM up as freshwater stream as long as possible
38:29
print lies which is why Sherman slake is not sure much so it's very difficult
38:35
situation and DOTA in order to provide some funding at the state dollars if
38:43
they use it so the fact that do t was on site according to the newspaper article
38:49
is amazing to me
38:51
parent really good good news but it's going to take it here a little bit there
38:57
there in order to get this yourself i'll say that the lakes person said meeting
39:03
that really this is one of the worst situations any freshwater pond state you
39:11
consider that almost given the time frame isn't around 70 wait on now I wait
39:21
until the point where she saw this significant deterioration water follows
39:25
it's almost like that and have that kind of situation
39:29
catastrophic environmental problem where this is not an environmental problem in
39:35
that sense it's a saltwater intrusion
39:39
so this is a bit of strictly freshwater lake the funds available it would be
39:46
hyper local back is it's caught yet
39:50
ok America and just goes to follow them . not only for people do key there we
40:02
got authorization from them that we do it right
40:06
yeah yeah good so your your first graphic showed approximately eight
40:13
twelve percent of oxygen saturation level at a 12-foot level and then much
40:19
less at the 15 and 25 do you have I good numbers actually decided numbers are
40:26
actually do you do you anticipate that the repair the siphon will be able to to
40:35
reverse this or what really do
40:38
sure all weekend we can't promise it will happen overnight of what we do know
40:43
is that is these builders put in the day again in 1818
40:49
they have to cite this is a small as 14 inches large most 28 pages they were
40:54
both about the same level 22 foot level and they got them running and they had
40:59
they were getting fresh water at the bottom of the intake lesson time scale
41:06
that back for the absence of bigger siphoned off there really be a smaller
41:12
pipe through the 14-inch the name may the water faster but this is business do
41:19
what we can we can get it back
41:23
given time we get back to where it was before this before it's like and stop
41:28
working to follow up asset question directly to the next person and she's
41:36
types you think people use only to return this
41:40
that's because it's just going to be okay so next steps as I understand merit
41:51
our you're expecting an estimate to look though I argument to get to go anywhere
41:57
yet we need to figure out how are you get the site i'm starting to get right
42:03
we got to do tea and said we'd like you to help us with the engineering drawings
42:07
and the permits and a lot of women might like a little money we'll see what they
42:13
say if they won't help many of those things will go higher up a will there's
42:21
a very company has given us a name of the company in livermore that it works
42:26
with closely that does both into
42:28
so all of that is all that's doable next step . find money to pay for it but to
42:37
be there to me there's a clear path
42:39
ok and send me the luckiest thought that was going to be perfect so should we
42:47
expect you to come back with us an update at some point when might that be
42:56
I think three mommy sort of feeling when we have significantly more detail you'll
43:00
be delighted we would be delighted to come back in okay and no guests to win
43:09
that might well actually I expect we have 11 estimate week and then how long
43:16
you take us to get a yes or no from dotm what they'll help with that permits for
43:21
help for permits and become particularly the engineer and print off but bad i
43:27
think at that point we'll know whether we're going to have to go out by those
43:30
or whether we're going to we're going to have dop helps with you
43:36
provide in-kind contribution
43:40
ok so we as I say oh we're delighted to come back and talk to you we have
43:46
something to tell
43:47
ok ok thank you very much thank you very long great presentation thank you
43:54
you've done a lot of work they're good stuff
43:59
was there a loop to close on that because i thought i heard at the
44:08
beginning that merit said that right now he's looking for our world support
44:13
support as or so has that I think we have indicated in the past on a few
44:19
occasions are moral support I'm sensing a request for money down the road I'll I
44:26
wasn't trying to be all things really come back
44:29
ask you for help it could take any of the different forms that our talk helped
44:35
permitting money out your pocket and held personnel know you have a spare
44:41
little reply so we will we will stand by for that of course we're not going to be
44:48
bashful about about asking for support beyond wall and and nor should you and
44:54
will will not be bashful about struggling to respond depending upon
45:02
what your requested so thank you
45:04
okay great thank you thank you
45:08
ok on to the next item
45:11
Bob I think Europe with your parking audit information
45:19
oh maybe about a month later we got an email about a smart growth program
45:27
technical variety of topics and Mary on Barnes at the office participated in the
45:37
webinar and so we were looking at the possible topics and then can rail
45:44
k is on the joint don't call Mary Ellen and asked her and meeting to talk about
45:53
what you might be able to do what committee might be able to push forward
45:59
some of the parking issues that is targeting work plan so very own called
46:08
me and said what about that webinar and it turned out that program and one of
46:14
the topics technical technical support would be parking lots
46:21
now this is not really a grant program when we do is apply to this organization
46:27
and this is funded by US EPA and if you are awarded you receive the award what
46:37
do is get technical systems so this case the technical assistance would be in the
46:44
form of some experts and working experts to come to a meeting to discuss how to
46:53
conduct the hard drive and to actually may be the best party is to be a
46:58
technical resource of folks ask all the questions that seem to always come up
47:04
comes with
47:05
now the Joint Economic Development maybe just a little teaser proposed work areas
47:13
exposed marketing aspect you may be aware but anyway but these are some
47:18
issues that bc excuse area they want more information on a prohibited person
47:27
time right now to ours many spaces
47:30
absolutely well the conflict between employee in order parking taking apart
47:37
public parking spaces but the fact ways still the park additional parking needs
47:44
parking areas agree need to be developed in town how to deal with parking
47:51
violations to be strict or friendly with them consider strategic options such as
47:59
loading zones or quick office spaces and of writing better things that can and
48:05
brought up so i thought this might be interesting
48:10
no cost kind of technical assistance I already knew the camera scholars they're
48:19
going through something that all the same some of the same issues and a
48:22
moscato and their Board of Selectmen stats very interested in pursuing this
48:28
essentially is a joint work session if you folks are interesting change bc
48:34
voted unanimously last week to support an application if you folks are
48:42
interested I will
48:44
including the application its dual october six instead of seven rigorous
48:49
application but it still needs to be flushed out as a competitive program i
48:56
think they're going to bring six or seven nationwide
49:00
however this particular agency which is called Smart Growth America we have been
49:05
successful twice the reason past they were Scottish getting technical
49:10
assistance was essentially the next step and carry out to short hers program and
49:18
then and less gas until we got time a technical support staff big downtown
49:27
master plan application was like 20,000 college with assistance so if you're
49:35
interested I would ask you to decide later support and i will submit the
49:41
application
49:42
the only requirement to attend a joint work session but essentially community
49:50
want to get folks from the community probably hosted in our office and
49:57
expensive because we've got about a hundred spaces and enough room and
50:02
everyone gets part some of the options for parking
50:07
great thank you
50:10
so much questions for both let me just add in the pot came to the Joint
50:18
Economic Development Committee and this happened fairly rapidly because the
50:23
application deadline is $MONTH october 65 graciously came to the meeting on
50:30
very short notice to tell us about the opportunity can rail and Betty Maddox
50:35
that actually been working of parking issues as we talked about parking here
50:40
at the joy v Selectboard when Bill Hamlin was still on the board talking
50:46
about the parking availability for employees purchase visitors and talking
50:52
about low-cost vouchers or discount vouchers so parkings also been
50:58
identified the long-range strategic plan as an issue so the JDC talked about this
51:04
felt that particularly since it was a no cost to the town to participate that it
51:11
would be worthwhile to have the technical expertise if we were
51:15
successful in getting the approval from the smart growth program and we have
51:21
volunteers already looked into this i think the only question that i would
51:26
have sitting in this chair today is what would be the anticipated sort of
51:31
participation from folks like Tom or cheap hash or other individuals who work
51:38
for the town in terms of being a participant and you know dedicating some
51:44
of their time to this process so well you know I looked at parking lot it's a
51:50
bit on the internet expert but they're probably self-support know that
51:58
Scott tell me and we'll be involved at least organizationally there so i should
52:08
be the same thing here what he's got nice i'm doing this entire effort is
52:13
really going to be Susan effort with maybe some organizational systems from
52:18
administration but it's really good and the citizens business people willing to
52:27
go out and do whatever you do I'll parking space
52:32
ok thank you so so just so I understand then there there's not an expectation of
52:42
a lot of time commitment on the part of our town office staff
52:49
no I don't think so but you know the purpose of this is to inform folks how
52:56
to actually conducted on these are almost all these volunteers that's
53:03
purpose to train volunteers I said also the answer questions and for all of us
53:08
smarter so but is it can't be done reduced by volunteers is completely
53:18
separate from town
53:20
there's gotta be some time
53:23
right right right so the the initial step would be some level of training i
53:29
guess for our volunteers that would then conduct the order the order will be
53:33
conducted by citizens business owner rice
53:37
yeah maybe something to Lord how to do it
53:41
yeah it's been done many places we're going to do it and i think also there
53:46
are a lot of techniques you know like we talked to the at the JPC meeting for
53:54
example of Portland us with this parking kiosks and every Scott is actually it
54:01
was like going out
54:03
p do an experimental parking kiosks another one revised it and take it for
54:08
inside your original if say that they're going to be doing that I think 24 spaces
54:15
the back parking lot they're going to think it is 36 places they're going to
54:20
actually have a test site for the party so we'll learn about that technology and
54:26
many many others
54:28
how do you balance the needs of the visiting public with employees
54:37
ok ok ok so what we need is a motion apply
54:51
I'm very supportive but I would love for the most to come from somebody else's at
54:55
the co-chair of the JDC since we already promoted that from the JDC aspect i
55:03
don't want to have people feel that I'm just promoting one agenda
55:07
but i am very supportive of this and I will be happy to second emotions so well
55:13
then I'll put the motion forward for the putting the application going for the
55:17
audit partner got it right I'm happy the second okay thank you need any
55:23
additional discussion I think this is outstanding
55:28
this is just an outgrowth of work that we've been doing for years whether it
55:31
was the route 27 corridor plan the bike pedestrian plan our comp plan this is a
55:38
terrific next step and I'm i'm grateful that you and Mary Ellen were able to
55:42
bring that forward
55:44
yes i'll just have one comment for we vote that you know I think I mentioned
55:50
this my email to you Bob also that tom was on vacation with the JDC metso was
55:57
difficult given the timing to sort of coordinate but I think grant
56:01
opportunities when they involve the town we should really make sure the town
56:06
manager's integrated and involved in the conversation because usually the buck
56:12
stops right there so just moving forward I think that's always a good thing to
56:17
touch base with the town manager self and as when he mentioned we've got our
56:22
own folks working on parking around here as well so we need to keep them in the
56:27
loop too so so Bob just so I'm clear the first thing you need do you need a
56:34
letter this all right actually hopefully positively and I create a letter sent
56:43
okay so she has a great alright settlers anything else discussion ready to vote
56:51
somebody in favor okay
56:56
motion passes thank you thank you for coming
57:02
there's another item under the business one more and that what it says on my
57:10
agenda is appointment of Police Sergeant Pat Higgins as you know is retiring
57:16
force rosenblatt and the Union up some provisions because this particular topic
57:25
was covered in our contracts as far as retiring early and then hiring back but
57:33
few months back alley in the United work that provision out which will get ahead
57:37
to the union contract we negotiated next spring
57:40
I'm not sure what is date is 29 videos three retired heaters on thursday said
57:49
30 years is actually the 29th 30th back to work on the first right so we're
57:56
asking you to reappoint him as a 31st 33
58:03
ok so again we need a motion and motion to reappoint pad Higgins to to the
58:14
position of Sergeant on the first of $MONTH october well consider that so and
58:23
helps i will second
58:25
any other discussion discussion
58:28
no I mean we had previous step we had ok everybody in favor
58:36
thank you sooo pissed
58:39
ok public forum what is the public God for us tonight
58:45
anything in addition to what we've already heard great presentation mera
58:52
thank you hearing nothing
58:58
the next item is warrants
59:01
I move approval importance on careful denomination I'll second
59:09
all in favor okay i think it would be appropriate to have a brief executive
59:19
session so we need a motion for that as well sure i will move that we go into
59:27
executive session under mrs a 405
59:30
thank you you gotta be you have to be no soft be a yes our personnel matters girl
59:39

59:44
actually there's a 640 56 and thank you
59:50
personal matter all except a friendly amendment
