     Heavenly Father, we thank you for this day, as this is a day we had never seen. We thank you for the privilege of public service.  We realize as City Council persons that it is the Heavenly Father who has put us all together, we, many of whom, never knew one another, to serve people, our families, our communities, our neighborhood, and our city.
    We thank you for the privilege of all that it takes to improve the quality of life for all.  We especially thank you today for the visitation of a humanitarian and health guru, Glenn Ellis, and Sarah Collins Rudolph, who is a survivor of the Birmingham bombing.
    We thank you, Lord, for all those things that we try to do in thy name.  We ask, Lord, that you bless the homeless and the hungry.  We ask that you bless those who are ill in hospitals and nursing homes.  We ask that those who are lonely be comforted, that someone says a kind word or does a kind gesture that makes them know that they are cared about and that they are loved.
    And, Heavenly Father, we thank you for all those privileges that you give us in public service.  We hope that we might be examples to all who realize that we understand the importance of our focusing on what it takes to make a better city.
    We also want to say thank you for our wonderful President, our Mayor, and we ask, Heavenly Father, that you guide their feet that they may walk on the right path as they are trying to help all in our city.
    And now, Heavenly Father, we ask that you bless us all, keep us all. Let this day be a special one in the lives of all.  And we thank you again for all that we do in thy name.
    Amen.

    City Council, City of Philadelphia citation welcoming, honoring, and recognizing Ms. Sarah Collins Rudolph.
    The Council of the City of Philadelphia is pleased and proud to welcome, honor, and recognize Ms. Sarah Collins Rudolph, the lone basement survivor in the 1963 bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church, which was part of a pivotal moment in American Civil Rights history.

Speaker: COUNCILMAN DOMB
    Whereas, Sarah Collins Rudolph was born in Birmingham, Alabama, one of eight children, to Oscar and Alice Collins. She attended Brunetta C. Hill Elementary School where she was a student at the time of the bomb explosion which changed history and her life;

Speaker: COUNCILMAN GREEN
    Whereas, at approximately 10:22 a.m. on September 15th, 1963, an anonymous man phoned 16th Street Baptist Church.  The call was answered by acting Sunday school secretary, 14-year-old Carolyn Maull.  To Carolyn, the anonymous caller simply said "three minutes," before terminating the call.  Less than one minute later, the bomb exploded as five children were present in preparation for a sermon entitled "A Love That Forgives"; and

Speaker: COUNCILMAN GREENLEE
    Whereas, the explosion at the church killed four girls:  14-year-olds Addie Mae Collins, Sarah's sister, Carole Robertson, and Cynthia Wesley, and 11-year-old Denise McNair.  Sarah, the lone survivor in the basement, was 12 years old at the time;

Speaker: COUNCILWOMAN GYM
    On that day, according to news reports, Sarah and two of her sisters, Janie and Addie Mae, walked to church.  When the sisters arrived at 16th Street Baptist Church, Janie went up to her classroom and Addie and Sarah went to the basement to sit in the lounge and wait until Sunday school was over;

Speaker: COUNCILMAN OH
    Sarah and Addie saw three of their friends, Cynthia, Denise, and Carole, enter the lounge, and they acknowledged them before retreating to the ladies room.  Upon exiting the ladies room, Denise asked Addie to tie her sash and all of the sudden, "Boom." Sarah was suddenly blinded in both eyes. The last thing Sarah ever saw through her right eye...

Speaker: COUNCILWOMAN GYM
    The last thing Sarah ever saw through her right eye was her older sister crossing the end of Denise's purple sash between her hands while the girls talked and smiled;

Speaker: COUNCILWOMAN BROWN
    The bomb blew a big crater through the building and Sarah was standing right in front of it.  Disoriented and not knowing which way to go, someone came in, put Sarah in their arms and took her through the hole;

Speaker: COUNCILMAN TAUBENBERGER
    That same afternoon in the hospital Sarah, who had 21 pieces of glass embedded in her face and blinded in one eye, received news of her sister Addie's death.  She spent two and a half months in the hospital, including her 13th birthday; and

Speaker: COUNCILWOMAN GYM
    Whereas, the 16th Street Baptist Church was a large and prominent church located downtown just walks from Birmingham's commercial district and City Hall.  Since its construction in 1911, the church had served as the centerpiece of the city's African American community, functioning as a meeting place, social center, and lecture hall;

Speaker: COUNCILMAN JOHNSON
    Because of its size, location, and importance of the community, the church served as headquarters for Civil Rights mass meetings and rallies in the early 1960s. Birmingham was the most segregated city in the United States, and in April 1963, after an invitation by Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth to come help desegregate Birmingham, the city became the focus of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference;

Speaker: COUNCILMAN JONES
    The church became the departure point for many demonstrations that took place in the city.  On May 2nd, 1963, students ranging from 8 to 18 gathered at the church to march downtown and talk to the new mayor about segregation;

Speaker: COUNCILMAN HENON
    After leaving the church, they were met by police, and many were jailed.  By the time Children's Crusade and the ensuing demonstrations ended on May 10th, thousands of children and adults had been injured by firehoses and attack dogs and were incarcerated;

Speaker: COUNCILWOMAN SANCHEZ
    The 16th Street Baptist Church bombing, as it has come to be called, occurred 18 days after the march on Washington and was a turning point in the American Civil Rights Movement, as even hardened segregationists were appalled at the scale of violence directed at innocent people.  In his eulogy for the victims of the bombing, Dr. King said, "These children, unoffending, innocent and beautiful, were the victims of one of the most vicious and tragic crimes ever perpetrated against humanity"; and

Speaker: COUNCILWOMAN BASS
    Whereas, on May 24th, 2013, President Barack Obama posthumously awarded a Congressional Gold Medal to the four girls killed in the 1963 Birmingham church bombing.  The medal was awarded through public signing law No. 113-11, a bill which awarded one Congressional Gold Medal in recognition of the fact that the girls' death served as the major catalyst for the Civil Rights Movement and invigorated momentum, ensuring the signing into passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  The Congressional Medal was presented to the Birmingham Civil Institute; and

Speaker: COUNCILWOMAN PARKER
    Whereas, despite losing her sister and also one of her eyes as a result of the blast, Ms. Collins Rudolph states that she no longer feels bitter about the incident.  "Being bitter won't bring the girls or my sight back, so I have to forgive, because that is what God wants me to do."  Ms. Collins Rudolph currently travels throughout the country sharing her story and teaching youth that even though -- even through tragedy there is hope.

Speaker: COUNCILMAN O'NEILL
    Therefore, by virtue of this citation, the Council of the City of Philadelphia does hereby welcome, honor, and recognize Sarah Collins Rudolph, the lone basement survivor of the 1963 bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church, which was part of a pivotal moment in American Civil Rights history.

Speaker: COUNCILWOMAN BLACKWELL
    We welcome Ms. Collins Rudolph and also her husband, George C. Rudolph, and their friend, Mr. Anthony Richardson, to our city and commend her for many years of courage, tenacity, and perseverance, and extend to her the sincere respect and admiration of our legislative body.
    Thank you and congratulations.
    (Standing ovation.)

Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    The Chair recognizes Ms. Collins for remarks.

Speaker: MS. COLLINS
    I would like to thank everyone that participated in this program, and I just feel so very honored.
    As I was going through the trauma for many years, you know, the bombing took my sister, Denise and Carole and Cynthia.  It not only took their lives, but it took my life too.  I was never the same.  But just being here today, I just want to thank everyone that signed the resolution for me being here. Thank you so much, and I love you all and I love Philadelphia because --
    (Applause.)

Speaker: MS. COLLINS
    And also my husband love Philadelphia.  And I just want to thank Glenn Ellis for inviting me here.  He was one of my schoolmates, my husband schoolmates too, because we was all raised in Birmingham and we knew him from Hill School and Parker High School. So he was the one responsible for me being here.
    Thank you, Ellis.
    (Applause.)

Speaker: MS. COLLINS
    Thank you.  Thank you so much.  Thank you, Jannie.  I thank you all.  Thank you all that made this day so special to us, and God bless you.

Speaker: COUNCILWOMAN BLACKWELL
    Thank you.  We have a Liberty Bell as well.
    (Applause.)

Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
     Council will be at ease.
    (Council at ease.)

Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
     Thank you very much.
    At this time, the Chair recognizes Councilwoman Parker, who will present a resolution recognizing the Pennsylvania Chapter of the National Coalition of 100 Black Women on the 30th Anniversary of the Madam CJ Walker Luncheon.  Would Robyn E. Younger and those accompanying her please join the Councilwoman at the podium.
    (Councilmembers and guests approached podium.)

Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    And joining the Councilwoman, we also have Councilwoman Gym, Councilwoman Blackwell, and Councilwoman Quinones-Sanchez.

Speaker: COUNCILWOMAN PARKER
    Thank you, Mr. President.  Mr. President, it is extremely fitting that after honoring the courageous acts of Ms. Sarah Collins Rudolph and her ability to survive and simply make it, that today we pay honor and tribute to an organization whose progressive advocacy stands on the shoulders of those four little girls and Ms. Sarah Collins Rudolph in the honoring of the Pennsylvania Chapter of the National Coalition of 100 Black Women on the occasion of its 30th Anniversary of the Madam CJ Walker Awards Luncheon.
    I do need to state for the record that this organization has a very close history with the City of Philadelphia and Council in particular, as Councilwoman Cindy Bass for many years served as the Public Relations Coordinator; Councilwoman Reynolds Brown, a sponsor of several activities, a panelist; our very own Wilhelmina Moore, who was a longtime staffer here in the City Council of Philadelphia is everything National Coalition of 100 Black Women.  I think she's done every job.  And I've had the distinct honor of serving as the Ticket Chair for the Madam CJ Walker Awards Luncheon, and you all know that's an interesting job to have, for three years.  And Councilwoman Maria Quinones-Sanchez and Councilwoman Gym who have also been longtime supporters and Councilwoman Jannie Blackwell who has been a supporter since the very beginning.
    So we first want to just thank all of the women of City Council for joining in this presentation.
    City Council of Philadelphia resolution congratulating and honoring the Pennsylvania Chapter of the National Coalition of 100 Black Women on the 30th Anniversary of the Madam CJ Walker Awards Luncheon.
    Recognizing and honoring the members of the Pennsylvania Chapter of the National Coalition of 100 Black Women on the 30th Anniversary of the Madam CJ Walker Awards Luncheon and for the organization's commitment to the educational, political and economic empowerment of African American women throughout the City of Philadelphia.
    Whereas, the Pennsylvania Chapter of the National Coalition of 100 Black Women was founded in 1981 by Sylvia Webster, who was a past President and obviously Charter member, purposed to serve as a collective voice for progressive women of African descent committed to advocating for meaningful sociopolitical change; and

Speaker: COUNCILWOMAN BLACKWELL
     Whereas, the Pennsylvania Chapter of the National Coalition of 100 Black Women in 1982 swore in forty-two trailblazing leaders, of varying professional affiliations, including the Honorable Marian B. Tasco, Charisse Lillie-McGill, Audrey R. Johnson-Thornton, the Honorable Augusta Clark, Joann Bell, Velma Goode, Leslie Kernodle and Dr. Marschal-Neil E. Young; and
    Whereas, the organization's leaders quickly sprung into action, implementing an aggressive campaign to address the educational, economic, political and physical needs of women throughout the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, with a keen focus on urban cities and an array of programmatic and legislative remedies; and

Speaker: COUNCILWOMAN BASS
    Whereas, the organization boasts several signature programs that exhibit an unwavering -- that exhibit its unwavering mission, most notably the Educational Mentorship & Scholarship Awards Program, designed to support women and girls pursuing a post-secondary education, and the Madam CJ Walker Awards Luncheon; and
    Whereas, named in honor of the nation's first woman to become a self-made millionaire, the Madam CJ Walker Awards Luncheon celebrates local female entrepreneurs who successfully operate their own companies and demonstrate sound business practices; and

Speaker: COUNCILWOMAN BROWN
    Whereas, the Awards Luncheon also provides the Coalition's leaders with the opportunity to publicly acknowledge girls and women deeply invested in their academic, social and political advancement as recipients of its annual Scholarship contest.
    Parenthetically, I would add the luncheon is sold out with over 800 women coming together this coming Saturday.
    Whereas, the Madam CJ Walker Awards Luncheon, in its 30th year, is a Coalition staple which continues to be a shining example of the organization's commitment to female economic empowerment by generating over 700 attendees annually, providing a platform for networking and strengthening an unbreakable bond of female camaraderie; and

Speaker: COUNCILWOMAN SANCHEZ
    Whereas, in addition to commemorating this auspicious luncheon, the Pennsylvania Chapter of the National Coalition of 100 Black Women revel in the several noteworthy accomplishments including receiving the Susan G. Komen "Women's Champion Award," the "Chapter of the Year Award" from the National Coalition of Black Women, the rededication of the Iris V. Henderson Cancer Center at Mercy Hospital, in memoriam of a Coalition sister and the leveraging of local resources alongside National Leadership to successfully influence the confirmation of the first African American female U.S. Attorney General, Ms. Loretta Lynch; and
    Whereas, in honor of Women's History Month and in the closing of Black History Month, the women of the Pennsylvania Chapter of the National Coalition of 100 Black Women continue to be lauded and deservedly so, as local leaders invested in the educational, economic and political advancement of our local communities; now, therefore

Speaker: COUNCILWOMAN GYM
    Resolved, by the Council of the City of Philadelphia, that it hereby honors and recognizes the Pennsylvania Chapter of the National Coalition of 100 Black Women on the 30th Anniversary of the Madam CJ Walker Luncheon and for the organization's commitment to empowering African American women throughout the City of Philadelphia.
    Further resolved, that an engrossed copy of this resolution will be presented to the National Coalition of 100 Black Women, Pennsylvania Chapter as evidence of the sincere sentiments of this legislative body.
    Thank you.
    (Applause.)

Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    The Chair recognizes Ms. Younger for remarks.

Speaker: MS. YOUNGER
    Good morning.
    (Good morning.)

Speaker: MS. YOUNGER
    Recognizing City Council, it is a great honor to stand here as the President of the Pennsylvania Chapter.  My name is Robyn Younger and I am joined with our founding President, Sylvia Webster, who but for her and those 42 trailblazing women that Jannie Blackwell spoke of just a bit ago, we would not be here.
    Our theme this year for our 30th Annual Madam CJ Walker Awards Luncheon is so fitting today and at this time, Honoring Our Past and Investing in Our Future.  I do believe that nothing happens by happenstance and that it is divine design that we are here receiving this resolution today and joining the young ambassadors from the school here, investing in our future as well as recognizing those who have come before us who have paved a way for us to do the work that we do.
    It is bittersweet in that 34 years later, our organization and the advocacy work that we do is still needed in this century, but the fact that it is and that there are women that are standing beside me, behind me, and who stood in front of me recognize that and are willing to do that work give me great honor to stand here today and accept this resolution.
    And so I do thank the Council again and also those of you who were not familiar with our organization prior to this moment, that you listened deeply and you provide some time for the words that were presented to you and embrace this organization, support this organization in the work that it does and invest in our future.
    Thank you.
    (Applause.)

Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
     Council will be at ease.
    (Council at ease.)

Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
     Thank you.
    For our last presentation, I'd like to call on Councilwoman Blackwell, who will present a resolution recognizing Father Thomas W.S. Logan and Mrs. Hermione Logan.  Would Dr. Trotman and those accompanying him please join the Councilwoman at the podium.
    (Councilmembers and guests approached podium.)

Speaker: COUNCILWOMAN BLACKWELL
    We are grateful in this Council that we had the opportunity to honor Father Logan and his lovely wife while they were alive a few times.
    Resolution naming the unit block of 41st Street between Parish and Brown Streets to have, quote/unquote, "Logan Dignity Way," end of quote, added to the street signs in recognition of Father Thomas W.S. Logan -- now that we said it two ways -- and Mrs. Hermione Logan's servant-like leadership devoted to the Episcopal Church and our Philadelphia Community.

Speaker: COUNCILWOMAN BASS
    Whereas, the phenomenal historic contributions of service by Father and Mrs. Logan are well documented.  In 1945, Father and Mrs. Logan helped merge Calvary Monumental Church with St. Michael's Church, creating one of Philadelphia's first interracial congregations; and
    Whereas, they served as delegates to the Anglican conference in Cape Town, South Africa; and

Speaker: COUNCILMAN JONES
    Whereas, Father Logan was a member of the Restitution Commission, past president of the Homeless Fund, past president of the Tribune and Rafter's Charities, and one of the founders of the African American Museum, a lifetime member of the NAACP, and past Master of Worshipful Grandmaster of the Prince Hall Masons of Pennsylvania and the longest serving, oldest living member of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity; and

Speaker: COUNCILWOMAN BROWN
    Councilman Goode's fraternity.
    Whereas, in the early 1960s, Father and Mrs. Logan collaborated with Dr. Martin Luther King in organizational and fundraising efforts right here in Philadelphia to support Civil Rights strategies; and
    Whereas, Father and Mrs. Logan's spiritual servant leadership to humanity, church, education and community should be commemorated and memorialized, because they served with conviction, valor, dignity, unwavering faith and unparalleled commitment; and

Speaker: COUNCILMAN OH
    Whereas, the Logan's personified dignity as a way of being, conduct and expression.  It is the hope that this street sign will serve as an eternal reminder that dignity is an aspiration of love that we can extend to each other in our community; and

Speaker: COUNCILMAN JOHNSON
    Now, therefore, be it resolved, that the Philadelphia City Council, hereby name the unit block of 41st Street between Parish and Brown Streets to have "Logan Dignity Way" added to the street signs in recognition of Father Thomas W.S. Logan and Mrs. Hermione Logan's servant-like leadership devoted to the Episcopal Church and our Philadelphia Community.

Speaker: COUNCILWOMAN BLACKWELL
     Further resolved, that an engrossed copy of this resolution be presented to Father W.S. Logan and Mrs. Hermione Logan as a sincere expression of the Philadelphia City Council's gratitude and recognition. And we note that this was signed by our President and all members of City Council.
    Thank you.
    (Applause.)

Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    The Chair recognizes Dr. Trotman for remarks.

Speaker: UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER
    Thank you, Mr. President.
    Mr. President, Councilwoman Blackwell, and Councilmembers and fellow citizens, the Logan family -- this is father Logan's sister, Phyllis -- on behalf of our supply priests, the Reverend Father Harry White, the vestry, and members of Calvary-St. Augustine's Anglican Episcopal Church, a living monument to the first bishop of the United States of America, Bishop White, we thank you for the opportunity to serve the Belmont community at 41st and Parish with the memorial sign and symbol of decency and order as expressed in 1 Corinthians, Chapter 14, Verse 40 honoring the 44 years of servant leadership of the Reverend Father Thomas W.S. Logan and Mrs. Hermione Hill-Logan with "Logan Dignity Way."
    May the glory of God bless the City Council and the City of Philadelphia with peace profound.
    Thank you.
    (Applause.)

Speaker: UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER
     Mr. Trotman -- Dr. Trotman.  Oh, no.  Go ahead, please.

Speaker: MS. LOGAN-SIMMS
    I would just like to thank all of you for your support for my brother and sister-in-law for their legacy.  Thanks also to my family and the church family for coming out today.  Eternally thanks to God for this blessings and favor.
    Thank you very much.
    (Applause.)

Speaker: MR. TROTMAN
    Good morning.  I am Jim Trotman, Father Logan's nephew, and I am Professor Emeritus at West Chester University and the founding Director of the Frederick Douglass Institute.  All of that is for the young people to the left.
    My thanks, of course, to Council and especially to Councilwoman Blackwell for her dedication and her love of the Logans.  He spoke often of your relationship to him and of course to the Blackwell family.
    Just a couple of very brief comments.  The first is that the dictionary has a lot of words for dignity:  courage, strength, moral words having to do with character and so forth, but for Thomas Wilson Stearly Logan and Hermione Clark Hill-Logan, dignity is to be found in the word of God.  They would ask you, among other places, to turn to Matthew 5 where the Sermon on the Mount speaks to all of the homeless in our time and in theirs about those who mourn, those who seek righteousness and who are thirsty for justice.  So their definition of dignity is to be found in the word of God, but there is another aspect to all of this that we can all share in.  Thomas and Hermione Logan were part of a long, distinguished Philadelphia clergy and partnership that goes back to Bishop Richard Allen and his wife Sarah, to the Reverend Absalom Jones and his wife Mary, to the very Reverend Father Paul Washington and his wife Christine, and then to the Reverend Leon Sullivan and his wife Grace.  These were all pastors, partners, and public servants who worked their entire lives to make Philadelphia, our nation, our state, and our world a better place.  They would all end by saying "the glory is to God."
    Thank you.
    (Applause.)

    I also reserve the right as pursuant to the rules of Council to limit the repetitiveness comments of the same matter.
    I would ask the Chief Clerk please read the name of the first speaker.

Section: PUBLIC COMMENT

Speaker: CHIEF CLERK
    Jeffrey Braff, commenting on 160157.
    (Witness approached podium.)

Speaker: MR. BRAFF
    Good morning. Jeffrey Braff for the Center City Residents Association.  We are a civic association of approximately 1,000 households.  We cover the area between Broad Street and the Schuylkill River and between South and JFK.
    In a logical world, Philadelphia would not need the approval of Harrisburg to utilize different real estate tax rates for commercial and residential properties.  However, we live in a world where to implement such a differential, we need an amendment to the state Constitution, and such an amendment must pass two sessions of the Pennsylvania General Assembly and win the approval of the electorate in a general election.
    Press accounts suggest that a substantial majority in the Legislature have an anti-Philadelphia bias -- big surprise -- and are against raising taxes.  Putting the two together; in other words, giving Philadelphia the right to raise taxes, is a toxic mixture, generally doomed to failure.  Indeed, as recognized in the 5th and 6th "whereas" clauses of Resolution 160157, the General Assembly rejected such an effort in the fall of 2012, and Councilmember Parker has intimate familiarity with those difficulties in connection with remediation efforts involving AVI.
    As a philosophical matter, CCRA does not disagree that it would be better, as the resolution states, to have a constitutional amendment that does not restrict the City's flexibility. However, as a matter of public policy, CCRA agrees with the constitutional amendment being advanced by the Jobs Growth Coalition.
    More specifically, CCRA believes that the implementation of such an amendment would stimulate City employment in a thoughtful way that would not reduce City tax revenues. Furthermore, given the political realities, CCRA believes that a constitutional amendment that simply gave the City the right to have a residential and commercial real estate tax differential, without requiring a commensurate decrease in wages and business taxes, would not get past even a single session of the General Assembly. And just as importantly, passage of Resolution 160157 would be used as ammunition by anti-Philadelphia tax forces to thwart the proposed amendment. I urge you to reject the resolution.
    Thank you.

Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
     Thank you for your testimony.

Speaker: CHIEF CLERK
    Walter Spencer, commenting on 160012.
    (Witness approached podium.)

Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    Good morning.

Speaker: MR. SPENCER
    Good morning, Councilmembers.  My name is Walter Spencer.  I live in the Rittenhouse neighborhood.  Although I am not a beneficiary of LOOP, I speak today in support of Bill 160012, as amended, which extends the time that current participants can remain in the program beyond its current end date of 2023.
    This bill has no fiscal impact on the City budget until Fiscal Year 2024.  At that time, I estimate the foregone revenue to be less than $10 million.
    People may ask, Why is it necessary to extend LOOP now?  Why can't we wait until the program is closer to its end date?  The answer is simple. Extension will now give peace of mind to current program beneficiaries.
    I've spoken with current program participants who have done the arithmetic and have already determined that they will not be able to remain in their homes unless the program is extended.  Many of these people are currently retired or plan to retire by 2023, although they do not qualify for the Senior Citizen Tax Freeze.  They are unable to absorb a tax increase of $3,000 or more, which many of them will experience without passage of the bill.
    While I support passage of this bill today, I want to speak briefly about the income limit in the bill.  The current income limit is $95,050 for a family of two.  Under this bill, the income limit for Fiscal Year 2024 would drop to $64,000, even allowing for eight years of inflation.  I personally believe that this limit is too low.  If this limit is implemented, my analysis shows that over 2,000 property owners would pay more than 10 percent of their income in property taxes.
    I urge the Council to review this limit as more analysis becomes available, and I am able to assist in completing this analysis.
    Thank you.

Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
     Thank you for your testimony.

Speaker: CHIEF CLERK
    The following individuals are also commenting on 160012, if you'll come to the podium, in this order:  Kelvin Carrington, Jody Della Barba, Laverne Johnson, and Albert Hicks.
    (Witness approached podium.)

Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    Good morning.

Speaker: MR. CARRINGTON
    Good morning, members of Council, Council President, concerned citizens, taxpayers.  My comment on this bill is that I appreciate the passage of this bill in its current form, but I also believe that more work needs to be done on it.  And the problem I have with it is that when I read the bill and it gives me a number, then it says under the guidelines of CFR Subsection 5, or whatever it says, and I don't know where to go to find it, I'm like scared because it says low income. When I think of low income, I think of the poverty level.  So I was really frightened that it had already excluded me.
    That's all.  That's my comment for today.  Thank you.

Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
     Thank you for your testimony.
    (Witness approached podium.)

Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    Good morning.

Speaker: MS. DELLA BARBA
    Good morning, Council President and distinguished Councilmembers.  My name is Jody Della Barba.  I'm the President of GEAR, a civic group in South Philadelphia, the Girard Estate Area.  We're an RCO and have been a community group since 1982. It's an area with many seniors and longtime residents.  We were killed by AVI and the ridiculous process of reassessing properties.  There are properties assessed at 300,000 while the property next -- the exact property next door is assessed at 230,000, with more work done on it than the higher taxed one.  Also being killed by the practice of L&I handing out licenses for unwanted businesses and other atrocities like they were free movies tickets.
    Our seniors and longtime residents deserve more than this.  We try to keep our community clean and safe.  We try to maintain our homes and their value.  However, the lure of the ten-year tax abatement to the south of our community has taken many of our residents instead of bringing in first-time homeowners and those moving back from outside the City.  These loyal people and loyal homeowners in our area need something to make them feel that their loyalty to this city and the longevity they've been here meant something.  They need to know that as unwanted businesses pop up and their property values plunge, they won't be hit with yet another tax increase while their income remains stagnant.
    I ask you to vote to not only keep the LOOP exemption, but make it permanent for those who qualify.  I would even like to see the income level for LOOP be raised as prices for food, clothing and other necessities rise.
    Thank you so much, and I want to thank Councilman Kenyatta Johnson and Mark Squilla for sponsoring the bill.

Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
     Thank you for your testimony.

Speaker: MR. CARRINGTON
    Pardon me. When I gave my testimony, it's going to come up with no name on it.  My name is Kelvin Carrington.  Thank you.

Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
     Okay.  Thank you.  The record shall reflect that.
    (Witness approached podium.)

Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    Good morning.

Speaker: MS. JOHNSON
    Yes.  Good morning.  My name is Laverne Johnson and I'm here to represent the North of Washington Avenue --

Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
     Speak up a little louder, please.

Speaker: MS. JOHNSON
    My name is Laverne Johnson and I'm here on behalf of NOWAC, North of Washington Avenue Coalition in South Philadelphia area. We're north of Washington Avenue.
    To the members of Council, I am here to speak on behalf of North of Washington Avenue Coalition, NOWAC, in regards to Bill 160012, the extension of the LOOP.  We urge you to pass this bill. Most of the people benefiting from this program are senior citizens.  The extension of LOOP will enable us to remain in our homes beyond 2024.
    We are concerned about the income provision in the bill.  However, we have been assured that it will be reviewed in the near future.
    We extend our warmest thanks and appreciation to the support of this bill.  Councilperson Kenyatta Johnson and Mark Squilla as well as committee chair people -- Councilperson Jannie Blackwell, all of them have worked tirelessly to pass this bill.
    Again, we urge you to support the passage of the Bill 160012.
    Thank you so very much.

Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
     Thank you for your testimony.
    And Mr. Hicks.
    (Witness approached podium.)

Speaker: MR. HICKS
    Good morning.

Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    Good morning.

Speaker: MR. HICKS
    To this distinguished chamber and to each honorable member of it, my name is Albert Hicks, Jr.  I am here as a representative of the Hawthorne Empowerment Coalition, a neighborhood civic association established since 1999.  Our borders are between the east of 4th Street to the west of South Street -- 11th Street and from north of Washington Avenue to the south of South Street.  As of March 11th, we have added a new vice president, Mr. Haneef Nelson, here to my right, and a new vice president, Maria Curtis. Vivian Ng as corresponding secretary and Raed Nasser as treasurer, myself as recording secretary remain in our previous positions.
    In our community of Hawthorne, we have many homeowners that are long-term generational families in the area.  My family has five generations in Hawthorne.  There are a large number of other families that can make the same claim, maybe longer, in our neighborhood. So ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of these families, we, the members of HEC, would like to say that the majority of the residents of Hawthorne are in favor of Bill No. 160012 for the purpose of extending the Longtime Owner-Occupied Program for residential properties.
    We would also like to extend other heartfelt thank you to the Honorable Councilman Kenyatta Johnson and Mark Squilla for introducing this bill, and thanks to all those that are distinguished members of this body for voting to do the right thing here today.
    Good day to you all.  Thank you so much.

Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
     Thank you for your testimony.

Speaker: CHIEF CLERK
    James Abram, commenting on 160134.
    (Witness approached podium.)

Speaker: MR. ABRAM
    Good morning, Council.

Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    Good morning.

Speaker: MR. ABRAM
    My name is James Abram.  I am the President and founder of a veterans group called Pointman Soldiers Heart Ministry.  I'm a combat 100 percent disabled veteran of the Vietnam War.
    I see here Sister Sanchez introduced Bill 160134, an ordinance authorizing transfer in appropriations for Fiscal Year 2016 from the General Fund and then the names of all the departments, but I don't see appropriations for the veterans community.  These are the men and women who serve this country proudly.  And as you know, Councilman Clarke, we came to your office and we told you that the City was not prepared for the influx of veterans -- or soldiers coming in from Iraq and Afghanistan, and we told you that the City need a director of veterans affairs, and you rebuked us.  You said that the City do not need a director, because you hastily installed --

Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    Sir, I'm going to let you speak, but are you referencing anything in this particular legislation?

Speaker: MR. ABRAM
    Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  It's no --

Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    You can't reference what's not in the legislation.  You have to reference what's in the legislation.

Speaker: MR. ABRAM
    Okay.  It's no money for veterans in this appropriation. Why --

Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    But that's not -- the rules are you're supposed to reference what's in the legislation, not what's not in the legislation, because if you talk about what's not in the legislation, you could talk about anything.

Speaker: MR. ABRAM
    Well, I'm talking about veterans.

Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    I understand that, but I'm just saying the guidelines for the bill are you speak on something that's referenced in the legislation.  And I know your issue. We've talked several times.

Speaker: MR. ABRAM
    All right.

Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    You will have -- let me finish.  You will have an opportunity very shortly, next week, we start our budget process, and what I would recommend that if you want some support, additional revenue to go into the veterans issue, either be it in the City Council budget for the veterans office or for housing for veterans, that is the time when you'll be given an opportunity to make a presentation on what you would like to see in the budget.

Speaker: MR. ABRAM
    Okay.

Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    That will be the best way to do it, and I guarantee you'll get a receptive audience.

Speaker: MR. ABRAM
    All right.

Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    All right, sir.  Thank you.

Speaker: CHIEF CLERK

Speaker: MR. MERRETAZON
    Merretazon. Ari Merretazon.

Speaker: CHIEF CLERK
    Commenting on 160134.
    (Witness approached podium.)

Speaker: MR. MERRETAZON
    I'm the First Vice President of Pointman Soldier Heart Ministry, and my task is to make our presentation relative to Ordinance 160134 with the guidance that was given by the President of Council.
    In respect to this ordinance, the Office of Community Empowerment and Opportunity have a whole lot to do with veterans affairs, veterans in the City. So we want to make sure that that office also include veterans in its deliberation and its appropriation.
    In terms of the Office of Supportive Housing, obviously you know there's a major issue with veterans housing.  So likewise those are who are involved with that, to include veterans in that appropriation as well and --

Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    It's a very creative way of getting around the guidelines.

Speaker: MR. MERRETAZON
    Well --

Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    Sir, sir, sir, look --

Speaker: MR. MERRETAZON
    I'm in accordance with the guidelines.

Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    Sir.

Speaker: MR. MERRETAZON
    You know I'm in accordance with it.

Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    Calm down.  Sir, if you want to testify, you have to talk about what's in the legislation, not what's not in the legislation.  I am prepared -- and I told you before -- to make sure that you will have ample opportunity to talk about what we should do as it relates to veterans at the appropriate time, when you can actually have an opportunity to get money in for veterans.

Speaker: MR. MERRETAZON
    But what's available to me here is just --

Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    But, sir, the bill does not have anything to do with veterans.  And I understand your concern, but the guidelines --

Speaker: MR. MERRETAZON
    Well, it does. It does.  Legal Services.  Veterans --

Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    No.

Speaker: MR. MERRETAZON
    -- have a lot to do with Legal Services, have to do with housing, right?  It does.  Now, if you want to argue with me over that little small point --

Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    Sir, there's no --

Speaker: MR. MERRETAZON
    You going to turn me down over that small point, go right ahead.  It's --

Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    I'm not going to turn you down, sir.  I'm giving you --

Speaker: MR. MERRETAZON
    It's good enough with your behavior.
    (Microphone turned off.)

Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    Sir, we're not going to go back and forth. All right?  At the appropriate time, I will make sure I send you a notice directly so you can come down and testify on behalf of veterans support.  Okay?

Speaker: MR. MERRETAZON
    I would hope that when you have the opportunity to speak as a citizen of Philadelphia, that you do not give guidance to what they shouldn't say or what they should say.

Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    Sir, I'm just following the rules as established and I'm asking that you do the same.
    (Microphone turned off.)

Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    Sir, we're not going to do this today.  Thank you.  I'll make sure you get notice. Thank you.

    I'm here for Bill 160007, and I want to talk about that because as a retired City worker and a concerned neighbor of this city and this country, I think anything that the City Council can do here today to support anything with veterans.  Because if it had not been for the veterans, we would not have a City Council and then the Civil Rights Movement and the rights in this country to be able to participate --

Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    Let me make sure I understand.  What bill number?  You said 160007?

Speaker: MR. ARMOUR
    160007, and I'm saying for the funding of that bill. This is why I'm saying it's so important that we know there's a lot of things that we must fund, but the veterans is so significant, because this is infrastructure --

Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
     Mr. Armour, what does that have to do this bill?  This is a street strike bill, right?

Speaker: MR. ARMOUR
    That's the bill number you gave me.  Isn't that the bill y'all gave me?  And that's what I'm here to testify.

Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    This is a street strike bill.

Speaker: MR. ARMOUR
    Oh, you put a 7 down there.  But anyway, let me go on while I'm here.

Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    No, no, no.  This is a street strike bill. Do you want to testify -- that's about a street that lies at the William Penn site.  If you want to talk about that, you can talk about that.

Section: 2ND READING

Speaker: MR. ARMOUR
    Why did you give me that number?
    But anyhow, let me just say to the Council real quick.  I have time --

Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    Not anyhow, Mr. Armour.  Ron, Ron, come on.

Speaker: CHIEF CLERK
    There are no other speakers on the public comment list, Mr. President.

Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
     Thank you very much.
    And, again, for the record, we will be starting our budget process on March 29th, and everybody will have ample opportunity to talk about pretty much whatever they want to talk about related to the City's budget.  Thank you.

Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    The Chair recognizes Councilman Domb.

Speaker: COUNCILMAN DOMB
    Thank you, Page 105 Mr. President.  Before I move for the adoption of this resolution, I'd like to request that Councilwoman Gym have an opportunity to briefly comment on this resolution.

Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    I'm sorry.  Say the last part.

Speaker: COUNCILMAN DOMB
    Councilwoman Gym briefly comment on this resolution.

Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
     Thank you.
    Please do so.

Speaker: COUNCILWOMAN GYM
    Thank you very much, colleagues.  Today with the leadership of Councilman Domb and our colleagues on Council, we're introducing legislation to hold hearings on the issue of youth homelessness in Philadelphia.
    Youth homelessness is a major crisis in the City that goes largely under the radar.  Many of us on Council and one of the first acts of the Children and Youth and the Housing and Homelessness Committee took part in the Page 106 homeless count and focused particularly on the needs of our youth.
    Here in Philadelphia, our state has seen an increase of 18 percent in the rise in youth homelessness since the beginning of the recession, more than double the national average.  And from 2009 to 2013, the percentage of Philadelphia public school students who experience homelessness has risen by over 70 percent.  But while these numbers are growing, the services have failed to keep pace.  The Philadelphia Office of Supportive Housing has only 4,000 emergency shelter beds, only 70 of which are devoted specifically for youth.
    In meeting with a number of service providers, the impact of homelessness on our children has had devastating impacts on their development and success, and like most social ills, it disproportionately impacts low-income, minority, LBGTQ youth, and at-risk children. Page 107
    More than 40 percent of youth who age out of the child welfare system end up homeless by age 18, and more than half of homeless youth self-identify as LGBTQ.  There is only one crisis shelter in the entire City of Philadelphia, Covenant House, that exclusively serves young adults, and they spoke of an 18-year-old young woman who was eight months pregnant that came to their door for help but had to be turned away.  And as a body, we know that we have an obligation to make sure that not one more young person is turned away from the basic right to housing in this city.  We look forward to these hearings and in partnership with you.
    Thank you very much.

Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
     Thank you, Councilwoman.

Speaker: COUNCILMAN DOMB
    Thank you, Councilwoman Gym.
    With that, I move for the adoption of the resolution. Page 108
    (Duly seconded.)

Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    It's been moved and properly seconded.
    All those in favor?
    (Aye.)

Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
     Those opposed?
    (No response.)

Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    The ayes have it, and that resolution is adopted.

Speaker: CHIEF CLERK
    And a resolution acknowledging and recognizing March 29, 2016 as the 41st anniversary of the enactment of the Earned Income Tax Credit and urging the Pennsylvania General Assembly to join the 26 states plus the District of Columbia by enacting a state version of the Earned Income Tax Credit to help working families earning low wages meet basic needs, introduced by Councilman Domb.

And so I'm honored to have Captain Dan Quinn, Nick Freitas, a Virginia House delegate, and Captain Nick Panarella attending. And this body has been so supportive of the Special Forces Association and the issues involved.
    So certainly everyone please come by.  It's $45.  You could get your ticket at the door, checks made out to Page 113 Special Forces Association.
    Thank you very much.

Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
     Thank you, Councilman.
    And speeches on the part of the majority?
    And the Chair recognizes Councilman Johnson.

Speaker: COUNCILMAN JOHNSON
    Thank you, Council President.  I want to thank my colleagues today and say honorable mention to my co-sponsor of Bill 160012, Councilman Mark Squilla, and thanking all of my colleagues for voting favorably for this bill known as the Longtime Owner-Occupants Program, or LOOP.  For as long as a constituent or enrollee participates in the program, they have an opportunity to receive a tax relief.
    I want to also thank Councilwoman Jannie Blackwell, who is the Chair of Finance and who is a strong advocate of making sure those who need a voice has a seat at the table. Page 114
    And so as we look at passing this bill today, I want to publicly also acknowledge that there is still much work to do, but we wanted to start this process early and revisit it as we approach the year of 2024 for our longtime residents.
    I also want to thank the Administration for opening up the dialogue with us and working in partnership with us, we could protect our long-term residents.
    And so I just want to thank everyone for voting favorably upon this bill, because we know as we look at the issue of gentrification and gentrifying neighborhoods, it's very important that we engage in smart development without displacement.  And so -- and we will continue advocating for long-term residents who make low to moderate income levels.  And so we want to protect them as this great City of Philadelphia moves forward. Page 115
    So I just want to thank everybody publicly for their support. Thank you very much.  And if I don't see everyone, what is it, this week or next week, we prepare for Easter.  Is that correct, Council President?

Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    Yes, sir.

Speaker: COUNCILMAN JOHNSON
    That's next week, okay.  Maybe jumping the gun a little bit, but we won't be here next Thursday, correct?

Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    We will not be in this room.

Speaker: COUNCILMAN JOHNSON
    Okay. Well, everyone have a happy resurrection next Sunday if I don't see everyone. Take care.

Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
     Thank you, Councilman.
    The Chair recognizes Councilwoman Gym.

Speaker: COUNCILWOMAN GYM
    Thank you very much, Mr. President.  This week we Page 116 concluded a series of education town halls across the City that drew out hundreds of people talking about what it means to focus in on our young people and services that they need desperately in schools.  Among the most serious issues that we have been highlighting in City Council has been the issue of teacher vacancies, which is a stunning situation in which hundreds of classrooms and thousands of children are left without a teacher.  At one of the town halls, we heard of a 12th grader who has had two English teachers since September, lost their second English teacher in November and has not had an English teacher since. In fact, the principal sometimes substitutes and comes in to lead a 12th grade English class.  These are essential services.
    It is also encouraging at the same time that last night the District announced that they will hire 800 new jobs for teachers.  These are great jobs Page 117 in this city, and they have to be upheld. And we congratulate the District for taking a proactive role.  Councilwoman Blackwell, myself, my colleagues on Council who have hosted these folks who have come to the town halls know how essential this issue to push and push the District towards the essential things that young people need.
    But I do want to add that in order for those 800 jobs to come to Philadelphia, I believe that the School District of Philadelphia needs to have a teachers contract, a teachers contract that actually invites and lures teachers to our city.  The Philadelphia teachers have been without a contract for three years, and four years if you don't include an extension that included no pay raises.  If we're going to get 800 new jobs into this city, 800 jobs serving our youth and the best jobs in the City, we need to see a teachers contract go through, and I encourage my colleagues to Page 118 communicate that to the District and to make sure that these are -- this is a good contract.
    One quick addition as well, 75 minutes away from our city, refugee families who fled violence and unrest in their home communities are being imprisoned, including children, at the Berks County Residential Center.  We have nearly 100 immigrants and children living in dangerous conditions that have been identified by human rights organizations that are shocking to the census.
    Last January a federal detention center worker was arrested for repeated sexual molestation of young people, including witnesses by children. A human rights attorney filed a complaint where a two-year-old girl vomiting blood was told to drink water and then sent back to her cell.
    Substandard conditions in the shelter have led to widespread medical outbreaks, and children are being forced Page 119 to share sleeping quarters with adults they do not know and of the opposite sex.
    It is not in our -- I want to thank Council and especially Councilwoman Maria Quinones-Sanchez, which sent a letter in November demanding the immediate shutdown of the Berks Correctional Facility.  But I think that the ramping up of this message needs to be sent more broadly.  The Governor has ordered Berks closed.  The county commissioners are currently fighting to keep it open.  If there is anything that our Council colleagues can do to communicate to the Berks County officials that this detention center that incarcerates children of a young age and has seen inordinate human rights abuses, unconscionable human rights abuses needs to be shut down.  We need to let them know that immigrant families and young people are suffering under their watch. We want them to withdraw the appeal to keep the Berks County Center open and Page 120 release those families immediately.
    Thank you.

Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
     Thank you, Councilwoman.
    The Chair recognizes Councilman Squilla.

Speaker: COUNCILMAN SQUILLA
    Thank you, Mr. President.  I just have a short announcement.  First I'd like to congratulate Councilman Johnson on the LOOP bill passage and also the Administration willing to work with Council on that and also an ongoing -- willing to work ongoing with the average income to see how that would work moving into the future.  So it's an opener to start, and it's a great way to understand how Council and the Administration can work together to get something done.
    But my main announcement is that on Wednesday, the 23rd, next week, we're going to celebrate the 121st Anniversary of the Philly flag raising. It's going to be right outside at the Page 121 Municipal Services Building, and hopefully all Councilmembers will try to make that time to go over there.  The first city flag in the country for its 121st Anniversary will be raised on Wednesday, the 23rd at noon.
    So thank you very much.

Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
     Thank you, Councilman.
    The Chair recognizes Councilman Jones.

Speaker: COUNCILMAN JONES
    Thank you, Mr. President.  With all the serious issues that were discussed and dealt with today, I wanted to kind of lighten it up a little bit and say that spring has sprung and March has come and March Madness has ensued.  And I want to salute all of the Philadelphia-based and regional universities that made it to the Dance.  I want to salute Villanova.  I want to salute you and Cindy's Temple University but, most importantly, I want to salute those Saint Joe's Hawks.  And Page 122 we wish you luck up until the time you meet them, and then at that point, we'd like to be victorious in the 4th with Saint Joe's University.  But it's a good time.  It highlights our city, gives us three chances to make it through those treacherous brackets.  And I think I agree with President Obama on a great many things, but not on his selection for the final four.
    Thank you, Mr. President.

Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
     Thank you.  Thank you, Councilman.  We look forward to bragging rights, and for once, Councilman Squilla does not have a team in the championship.  For once, right?  Thank you.
    The Chair recognizes Councilman Domb.

Speaker: COUNCILMAN DOMB
    Thank you, Council President.  I just want to quickly reiterate the importance of the Earned Income Tax Credit.  The deadline for filing is April 18th.  We're one Page 123 month away.  I also want to just reiterate the non-privileged resolution we introduced today, which was to urge the State of Pennsylvania, the General Assembly to enact a state Earned Income Tax Credit.  Twenty-six states have this. And the poverty level in the state is 13.7; Philadelphia is 26 percent.  And I also want to challenge the media, all of our major TV stations, all of our news outlets, to publicize -- this is four weeks and counting -- for the Earned Income Tax Credit, of which last year we left $100 million that could have gone to 40,000 families.  We need the media to publicize this.  It's very important. We're down to the last four weeks.  So anything that the media can do, we'd be most appreciative.
    Thank you.

Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
     Thank you, Councilman.
    That concludes the speeches, and the Chair recognizes Councilwoman Page 124 Reynolds Brown for a motion to adjourn.

Section: ADJOURNMENT

Speaker: COUNCILWOMAN BROWN
    Yes, Mr. President.  I will do that.  I just want to go on the record to express my personal appreciation to Councilwoman Jannie Blackwell.  As a former educator and someone who has a deep appreciation for history, the salute today and recognizing Sarah Collins Rudolph was deeply profound, and if we were paying attention, you could not hear a pin drop during the salute of her story.
    So I want to thank Councilwoman Blackwell for making that happen and for reminding us that the struggle continues.
    With that said, thank you, Mr. President.  I move that Council stand adjourned until Thursday, March 31st, 2016 at 10:00 a.m.
    (Duly seconded.)

Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
    It's been moved and properly seconded that Council stand adjourned until Thursday, March 31st, 2016, 10:00 a.m. Page 125
    All those in favor say aye.
    (Aye.)

Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
     Those opposed?
    (No response.)

Speaker: COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE
     Thank you very much.
    (Stated Meeting adjourned at 12:35 p.m.)
