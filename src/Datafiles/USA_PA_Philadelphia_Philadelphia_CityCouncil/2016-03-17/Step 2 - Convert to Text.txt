5    people, our families, our communities,
6    our neighborhood, and our city.
7              We thank you for the privilege
8    of all that it takes to improve the

13    a survivor of the Birmingham bombing.
14              We thank you, Lord, for all
15    those things that we try to do in thy
16    name.  We ask, Lord, that you bless the
17    homeless and the hungry.  We ask that you
18    bless those who are ill in hospitals and
19    nursing homes.  We ask that those who are
20    lonely be comforted, that someone says a
21    kind word or does a kind gesture that
22    makes them know that they are cared about
23    and that they are loved.

2    approximately 10:22 a.m. on September
3    15th, 1963, an anonymous man phoned 16th
4    Street Baptist Church.  The call was
5    answered by acting Sunday school
6    secretary, 14-year-old Carolyn Maull.  To
7    Carolyn, the anonymous caller simply said
8    "three minutes," before terminating the
9    call.  Less than one minute later, the
10    bomb exploded as five children were
11    present in preparation for a sermon
12    entitled "A Love That Forgives"; and
13              COUNCILMAN GREENLEE:  Whereas,
14    the explosion at the church killed four

16    Sarah's sister, Carole Robertson, and
17    Cynthia Wesley, and 11-year-old Denise
18    McNair.  Sarah, the lone survivor in the

5              COUNCILMAN OH:  Sarah and Addie
6    saw three of their friends, Cynthia,
7    Denise, and Carole, enter the lounge, and
8    they acknowledged them before retreating
9    to the ladies room.  Upon exiting the
10    ladies room, Denise asked Addie to tie
11    her sash and all of the sudden, "Boom."
12    Sarah was suddenly blinded in both eyes.
13    The last thing Sarah ever saw through her
14    right eye...
15              COUNCILWOMAN GYM:  The last
16    thing Sarah ever saw through her right
17    eye was her older sister crossing the end
18    of Denise's purple sash between her hands
19    while the girls talked and smiled;
20              COUNCILWOMAN BROWN:  The bomb
21    blew a big crater through the building
22    and Sarah was standing right in front of
23    it.  Disoriented and not knowing which
24    way to go, someone came in, put Sarah in
25    their arms and took her through the hole;

3    same afternoon in the hospital Sarah, who
4    had 21 pieces of glass embedded in her
5    face and blinded in one eye, received
6    news of her sister Addie's death.  She
7    spent two and a half months in the
8    hospital, including her 13th birthday;
9    and
10              COUNCILWOMAN GYM:  Whereas, the
11    16th Street Baptist Church was a large
12    and prominent church located downtown
13    just walks from Birmingham's commercial
14    district and City Hall.  Since its
15    construction in 1911, the church had
16    served as the centerpiece of the city's
17    African American community, functioning
18    as a meeting place, social center, and
19    lecture hall;
20              COUNCILMAN JOHNSON:  Because of
21    its size, location, and importance of the
22    community, the church served as
23    headquarters for Civil Rights mass
24    meetings and rallies in the early 1960s.

2    in the United States, and in April 1963,
3    after an invitation by Reverend Fred
4    Shuttlesworth to come help desegregate
5    Birmingham, the city became the focus of
6    Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and the
7    Southern Christian Leadership Conference;
8              COUNCILMAN JONES:  The church
9    became the departure point for many
10    demonstrations that took place in the
11    city.  On May 2nd, 1963, students ranging
12    from 8 to 18 gathered at the church to
13    march downtown and talk to the new mayor
14    about segregation;
15              COUNCILMAN HENON:  After
16    leaving the church, they were met by
17    police, and many were jailed.  By the
18    time Children's Crusade and the ensuing
19    demonstrations ended on May 10th,
20    thousands of children and adults had been
21    injured by firehoses and attack dogs and
22    were incarcerated;

2    the march on Washington and was a turning
3    point in the American Civil Rights
4    Movement, as even hardened
5    segregationists were appalled at the
6    scale of violence directed at innocent
7    people.  In his eulogy for the victims of
8    the bombing, Dr. King said, "These
9    children, unoffending, innocent and
10    beautiful, were the victims of one of the
11    most vicious and tragic crimes ever
12    perpetrated against humanity"; and
13              COUNCILWOMAN BASS:  Whereas, on
14    May 24th, 2013, President Barack Obama
15    posthumously awarded a Congressional Gold
16    Medal to the four girls killed in the
17    1963 Birmingham church bombing.  The
18    medal was awarded through public signing
19    law No. 113-11, a bill which awarded one
20    Congressional Gold Medal in recognition
21    of the fact that the girls' death served
22    as the major catalyst for the Civil
23    Rights Movement and invigorated momentum,
24    ensuring the signing into passage of the
25    Civil Rights Act of 1964.  The

5    despite losing her sister and also one of
6    her eyes as a result of the blast, Ms.
7    Collins Rudolph states that she no longer
8    feels bitter about the incident.  "Being
9    bitter won't bring the girls or my sight
10    back, so I have to forgive, because that
11    is what God wants me to do."  Ms. Collins
12    Rudolph currently travels throughout the
13    country sharing her story and teaching
14    youth that even though -- even through
15    tragedy there is hope.

5    am Jim Trotman, Father Logan's nephew,
6    and I am Professor Emeritus at West
7    Chester University and the founding
8    Director of the Frederick Douglass
9    Institute.  All of that is for the young
10    people to the left.
11              My thanks, of course, to
12    Council and especially to Councilwoman
13    Blackwell for her dedication and her love
14    of the Logans.  He spoke often of your
15    relationship to him and of course to the
16    Blackwell family.
17              Just a couple of very brief
18    comments.  The first is that the
19    dictionary has a lot of words for
20    dignity:  courage, strength, moral words
21    having to do with character and so forth,
22    but for Thomas Wilson Stearly Logan and
23    Hermione Clark Hill-Logan, dignity is to
24    be found in the word of God.  They would

2    Matthew 5 where the Sermon on the Mount
3    speaks to all of the homeless in our time
4    and in theirs about those who mourn,
5    those who seek righteousness and who are
6    thirsty for justice.  So their definition
7    of dignity is to be found in the word of
8    God, but there is another aspect to all
9    of this that we can all share in.  Thomas
10    and Hermione Logan were part of a long,
11    distinguished Philadelphia clergy and
12    partnership that goes back to Bishop
13    Richard Allen and his wife Sarah, to the
14    Reverend Absalom Jones and his wife Mary,
15    to the very Reverend Father Paul
16    Washington and his wife Christine, and
17    then to the Reverend Leon Sullivan and
18    his wife Grace.  These were all pastors,
19    partners, and public servants who worked
20    their entire lives to make Philadelphia,
21    our nation, our state, and our world a
22    better place.  They would all end by
23    saying "the glory is to God."

2    Philadelphia would not need the approval
3    of Harrisburg to utilize different real
4    estate tax rates for commercial and
5    residential properties.  However, we live
6    in a world where to implement such a
7    differential, we need an amendment to the
8    state Constitution, and such an amendment
9    must pass two sessions of the
10    Pennsylvania General Assembly and win the
11    approval of the electorate in a general
12    election.
13              Press accounts suggest that a
14    substantial majority in the Legislature
15    have an anti-Philadelphia bias -- big
16    surprise -- and are against raising
17    taxes.  Putting the two together; in
18    other words, giving Philadelphia the
19    right to raise taxes, is a toxic mixture,
20    generally doomed to failure.  Indeed, as
21    recognized in the 5th and 6th "whereas"
22    clauses of Resolution 160157, the General
23    Assembly rejected such an effort in the
24    fall of 2012, and Councilmember Parker

2    difficulties in connection with
3    remediation efforts involving AVI.
4              As a philosophical matter, CCRA
5    does not disagree that it would be
6    better, as the resolution states, to have
7    a constitutional amendment that does not
8    restrict the City's flexibility.
9    However, as a matter of public policy,
10    CCRA agrees with the constitutional
11    amendment being advanced by the Jobs
12    Growth Coalition.
13              More specifically, CCRA
14    believes that the implementation of such
15    an amendment would stimulate City
16    employment in a thoughtful way that would
17    not reduce City tax revenues.
18    Furthermore, given the political
19    realities, CCRA believes that a
20    constitutional amendment that simply gave
21    the City the right to have a residential
22    and commercial real estate tax
23    differential, without requiring a
24    commensurate decrease in wages and

2    on the City budget until Fiscal Year
3    2024.  At that time, I estimate the
4    foregone revenue to be less than $10
5    million.
6              People may ask, Why is it
7    necessary to extend LOOP now?  Why can't
8    we wait until the program is closer to
9    its end date?  The answer is simple.
10    Extension will now give peace of mind to
11    current program beneficiaries.
12              I've spoken with current
13    program participants who have done the
14    arithmetic and have already determined
15    that they will not be able to remain in
16    their homes unless the program is
17    extended.  Many of these people are
18    currently retired or plan to retire by
19    2023, although they do not qualify for
20    the Senior Citizen Tax Freeze.  They are
21    unable to absorb a tax increase of $3,000
22    or more, which many of them will
23    experience without passage of the bill.

2    the income limit in the bill.  The
3    current income limit is $95,050 for a
4    family of two.  Under this bill, the
5    income limit for Fiscal Year 2024 would
6    drop to $64,000, even allowing for eight
7    years of inflation.  I personally believe
8    that this limit is too low.  If this
9    limit is implemented, my analysis shows
10    that over 2,000 property owners would pay
11    more than 10 percent of their income in
12    property taxes.
13              I urge the Council to review
14    this limit as more analysis becomes
15    available, and I am able to assist in
16    completing this analysis.

5              MR. CARRINGTON:  Good morning,
6    members of Council, Council President,
7    concerned citizens, taxpayers.  My
8    comment on this bill is that I appreciate
9    the passage of this bill in its current
10    form, but I also believe that more work
11    needs to be done on it.  And the problem
12    I have with it is that when I read the
13    bill and it gives me a number, then it
14    says under the guidelines of CFR
15    Subsection 5, or whatever it says, and I
16    don't know where to go to find it, I'm
17    like scared because it says low income.
18    When I think of low income, I think of
19    the poverty level.  So I was really
20    frightened that it had already excluded
21    me.
22              That's all.  That's my comment

6    Council President and distinguished
7    Councilmembers.  My name is Jody Della
8    Barba.  I'm the President of GEAR, a
9    civic group in South Philadelphia, the
10    Girard Estate Area.  We're an RCO and
11    have been a community group since 1982.
12    It's an area with many seniors and
13    longtime residents.  We were killed by
14    AVI and the ridiculous process of
15    reassessing properties.  There are
16    properties assessed at 300,000 while the
17    property next -- the exact property next
18    door is assessed at 230,000, with more
19    work done on it than the higher taxed
20    one.  Also being killed by the practice
21    of L&I handing out licenses for unwanted
22    businesses and other atrocities like they
23    were free movies tickets.

2    to keep our community clean and safe.  We
3    try to maintain our homes and their
4    value.  However, the lure of the ten-year
5    tax abatement to the south of our
6    community has taken many of our residents
7    instead of bringing in first-time
8    homeowners and those moving back from
9    outside the City.  These loyal people and
10    loyal homeowners in our area need
11    something to make them feel that their
12    loyalty to this city and the longevity
13    they've been here meant something.  They
14    need to know that as unwanted businesses
15    pop up and their property values plunge,
16    they won't be hit with yet another tax
17    increase while their income remains
18    stagnant.
19              I ask you to vote to not only
20    keep the LOOP exemption, but make it
21    permanent for those who qualify.  I would
22    even like to see the income level for

3              In our community of Hawthorne,
4    we have many homeowners that are
5    long-term generational families in the
6    area.  My family has five generations in
7    Hawthorne.  There are a large number of
8    other families that can make the same
9    claim, maybe longer, in our neighborhood.
10    So ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of
11    these families, we, the members of HEC,
12    would like to say that the majority of
13    the residents of Hawthorne are in favor
14    of Bill No. 160012 for the purpose of
15    extending the Longtime Owner-Occupied
16    Program for residential properties.
17              We would also like to extend
18    other heartfelt thank you to the
19    Honorable Councilman Kenyatta Johnson and
20    Mark Squilla for introducing this bill,
21    and thanks to all those that are
22    distinguished members of this body for

15    very much, colleagues.  Today with the
16    leadership of Councilman Domb and our
17    colleagues on Council, we're introducing
18    legislation to hold hearings on the issue
19    of youth homelessness in Philadelphia.
20              Youth homelessness is a major
21    crisis in the City that goes largely
22    under the radar.  Many of us on Council
23    and one of the first acts of the Children
24    and Youth and the Housing and
25    Homelessness Committee took part in the

2    homeless count and focused particularly
3    on the needs of our youth.
4              Here in Philadelphia, our state
5    has seen an increase of 18 percent in the
6    rise in youth homelessness since the
7    beginning of the recession, more than
8    double the national average.  And from
9    2009 to 2013, the percentage of
10    Philadelphia public school students who
11    experience homelessness has risen by over
12    70 percent.  But while these numbers are
13    growing, the services have failed to keep
14    pace.  The Philadelphia Office of
15    Supportive Housing has only 4,000
16    emergency shelter beds, only 70 of which
17    are devoted specifically for youth.
18              In meeting with a number of
19    service providers, the impact of
20    homelessness on our children has had
21    devastating impacts on their development
22    and success, and like most social ills,
23    it disproportionately impacts low-income,
24    minority, LBGTQ youth, and at-risk
25    children.

2              More than 40 percent of youth
3    who age out of the child welfare system
4    end up homeless by age 18, and more than
5    half of homeless youth self-identify as
6    LGBTQ.  There is only one crisis shelter
7    in the entire City of Philadelphia,
8    Covenant House, that exclusively serves
9    young adults, and they spoke of an
10    18-year-old young woman who was eight
11    months pregnant that came to their door
12    for help but had to be turned away.  And
13    as a body, we know that we have an
14    obligation to make sure that not one more
15    young person is turned away from the
16    basic right to housing in this city.  We
17    look forward to these hearings and in

14    Councilman Mark Squilla, and thanking all
15    of my colleagues for voting favorably for
16    this bill known as the Longtime

14              And so I just want to thank

16    bill, because we know as we look at the
17    issue of gentrification and gentrifying
18    neighborhoods, it's very important that

7    correct, Council President?
8              COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE:  Yes,
9    sir.
10              COUNCILMAN JOHNSON:  That's
11    next week, okay.  Maybe jumping the gun a
12    little bit, but we won't be here next
13    Thursday, correct?
14              COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE:  We
15    will not be in this room.
16              COUNCILMAN JOHNSON:  Okay.
17    Well, everyone have a happy resurrection
18    next Sunday if I don't see everyone.
19    Take care.
20              COUNCIL PRESIDENT CLARKE:
21    Thank you, Councilman.

2    concluded a series of education town
3    halls across the City that drew out
4    hundreds of people talking about what it
5    means to focus in on our young people and
6    services that they need desperately in
7    schools.  Among the most serious issues
8    that we have been highlighting in City
9    Council has been the issue of teacher
10    vacancies, which is a stunning situation
11    in which hundreds of classrooms and
12    thousands of children are left without a
13    teacher.  At one of the town halls, we
14    heard of a 12th grader who has had two
15    English teachers since September, lost
16    their second English teacher in November
17    and has not had an English teacher since.
18    In fact, the principal sometimes
19    substitutes and comes in to lead a 12th
20    grade English class.  These are essential
21    services.
22              It is also encouraging at the
23    same time that last night the District
24    announced that they will hire 800 new
25    jobs for teachers.  These are great jobs

2    in this city, and they have to be upheld.
3    And we congratulate the District for
4    taking a proactive role.  Councilwoman
5    Blackwell, myself, my colleagues on
6    Council who have hosted these folks who
7    have come to the town halls know how
8    essential this issue to push and push the
9    District towards the essential things
10    that young people need.
11              But I do want to add that in
12    order for those 800 jobs to come to
13    Philadelphia, I believe that the School
14    District of Philadelphia needs to have a
15    teachers contract, a teachers contract
16    that actually invites and lures teachers
17    to our city.  The Philadelphia teachers
18    have been without a contract for three
19    years, and four years if you don't
20    include an extension that included no pay
21    raises.  If we're going to get 800 new
22    jobs into this city, 800 jobs serving our
23    youth and the best jobs in the City, we
24    need to see a teachers contract go
25    through, and I encourage my colleagues to

2    communicate that to the District and to
3    make sure that these are -- this is a
4    good contract.
5              One quick addition as well, 75
6    minutes away from our city, refugee
7    families who fled violence and unrest in
8    their home communities are being
9    imprisoned, including children, at the
10    Berks County Residential Center.  We have
11    nearly 100 immigrants and children living
12    in dangerous conditions that have been
13    identified by human rights organizations
14    that are shocking to the census.
15              Last January a federal
16    detention center worker was arrested for
17    repeated sexual molestation of young
18    people, including witnesses by children.
19    A human rights attorney filed a complaint
20    where a two-year-old girl vomiting blood
21    was told to drink water and then sent
22    back to her cell.
23              Substandard conditions in the
24    shelter have led to widespread medical
25    outbreaks, and children are being forced

2    to share sleeping quarters with adults
3    they do not know and of the opposite sex.
4              It is not in our -- I want to
5    thank Council and especially Councilwoman
6    Maria Quinones-Sanchez, which sent a
7    letter in November demanding the
8    immediate shutdown of the Berks
9    Correctional Facility.  But I think that
10    the ramping up of this message needs to
11    be sent more broadly.  The Governor has
12    ordered Berks closed.  The county
13    commissioners are currently fighting to
14    keep it open.  If there is anything that
15    our Council colleagues can do to
16    communicate to the Berks County officials
17    that this detention center that
18    incarcerates children of a young age and
19    has seen inordinate human rights abuses,
20    unconscionable human rights abuses needs
21    to be shut down.  We need to let them
22    know that immigrant families and young
23    people are suffering under their watch.
24    We want them to withdraw the appeal to
25    keep the Berks County Center open and

8              COUNCILMAN SQUILLA:  Thank you,
9    Mr. President.  I just have a short
10    announcement.  First I'd like to
11    congratulate Councilman Johnson on the
12    LOOP bill passage and also the
13    Administration willing to work with
14    Council on that and also an ongoing --
15    willing to work ongoing with the average
16    income to see how that would work moving
17    into the future.  So it's an opener to
18    start, and it's a great way to understand
19    how Council and the Administration can
20    work together to get something done.
21              But my main announcement is
22    that on Wednesday, the 23rd, next week,
23    we're going to celebrate the 121st
24    Anniversary of the Philly flag raising.

16    today, I wanted to kind of lighten it up
17    a little bit and say that spring has
18    sprung and March has come and March
19    Madness has ensued.  And I want to salute
20    all of the Philadelphia-based and
21    regional universities that made it to the
22    Dance.  I want to salute Villanova.  I
23    want to salute you and Cindy's Temple

25    to salute those Saint Joe's Hawks.  And

2    we wish you luck up until the time you
3    meet them, and then at that point, we'd
4    like to be victorious in the 4th with
5    Saint Joe's University.  But it's a good
6    time.  It highlights our city, gives us
7    three chances to make it through those
8    treacherous brackets.  And I think I

10    many things, but not on his selection for
11    the final four.

2    month away.  I also want to just
3    reiterate the non-privileged resolution
4    we introduced today, which was to urge
5    the State of Pennsylvania, the General
6    Assembly to enact a state Earned Income
7    Tax Credit.  Twenty-six states have this.
8    And the poverty level in the state is
9    13.7; Philadelphia is 26 percent.  And I
10    also want to challenge the media, all of
11    our major TV stations, all of our news
12    outlets, to publicize -- this is four
13    weeks and counting -- for the Earned
14    Income Tax Credit, of which last year we
15    left $100 million that could have gone to
16    40,000 families.  We need the media to
17    publicize this.  It's very important.
18    We're down to the last four weeks.  So
19    anything that the media can do, we'd be
20    most appreciative.
21              Thank you.

2    Reynolds Brown for a motion to adjourn.
3              COUNCILWOMAN BROWN:  Yes,
4    Mr. President.  I will do that.  I just
5    want to go on the record to express my
6    personal appreciation to Councilwoman
7    Jannie Blackwell.  As a former educator
8    and someone who has a deep appreciation
9    for history, the salute today and
10    recognizing Sarah Collins Rudolph was
11    deeply profound, and if we were paying
12    attention, you could not hear a pin drop
13    during the salute of her story.
14              So I want to thank Councilwoman
15    Blackwell for making that happen and for
16    reminding us that the struggle continues.
17              With that said, thank you,
18    Mr. President.  I move that Council stand
