The files in this folder are original transcripts from actual meetings.

Each top-level folder is named as follows:
	<country-abbrev>_<state_abbrev>_<county>_<city>
Within each folder, the files are named as follows:
	<government-body>_<date>.<pdf/txt>
However, this naming will need to vary, if these designations are not applicable for a 
particular country or region..

Please add others as you find them. The more samples we have to work with, the better.
We need samples from other countries and in other languages than English.
