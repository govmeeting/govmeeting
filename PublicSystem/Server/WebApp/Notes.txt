I created the original WebApp project by choosing the template for: C# Web App -> ASP.NET 5 -> authentication = "Individual User Accounts"

I then started making changes both to the generated code and by adding my own features.
I changed the generated registration and login code to incorporate the improved features outlined in the  video:
	"ASP.NET Identity 3 for ASP.NET CORE - by Brock Allen", who is the creator of Identity Manager

ASP.NET 5 is now renamed ASP.NET Core. There were also many changes made in the new version. The majority of the referenced Microsoft DLL are new.
This includes not only those changed from "Microsoft.ASPNET.xxxxxx" to "Microsoft.Asp.NetCore.xxxxx but most of the others.
I could go through a step by step guide for upgrading my code to the new release. But it may be much easier to do it this way:
(1) Re-generate the project with the new Asp.Net Core template
(2) Replace code that shouldn't be effected by the upgrade (models, views, controllers) with my own.

I created WebAppCore project as: C# Web App -> ASP.NET Core Web Application (.NET Core).
 In the combo box above ".NET Framework 4.5.2" was selected. Is this selection applicable to my choice? In the dropdown, only .NET Frameworks 2.0 to 4.6.1 show.
 There is a choice "More Frameworks". This takes us to a web page where we can download other frameworks.
 For Visual Studio 2013, the only choices are those in the drop down combo boax list.
 For VS 2015, there are many more choices, including some for .NET Core 1.0 and ASP.NET Core 1.0.

I selected authentication = Individual User Accounts

I replaced the generated "startup.cs" with that from the WebApp project.

I added the following reference:
	Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Google
