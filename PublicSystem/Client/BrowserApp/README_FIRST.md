All of the code for the Govmeeting project is under the "src" folder.
Everything else in this BrowserApp folder is a part of the "angular2-seed" project,
exept for the file you are currently reading..
Angular2-seed is hosted at https://github.com/mgechev/angular2-seed.
It contains the tooling that allows us to develop in a very modular fashion.


The folder "src" contains our source code for Govmeeting.
The only file in this folder which is ours is the one you are reading now "README_FIRST.md"

The other sub-folders in this folder, which belong to the Angular-seed project are:

dist   -   the distribution files, in other words, files generated by Angular2-seed from processing
            our source files. Within the dist folder is the "prod" folder for the production version 
            and the "dev" folder for the development version. The difference between these two is that 
            the prod files are the dev files after they have been minimized and bundled.
tools   -   Angular2-seed source files, written mostly in Typescript. You will find these in the tools/tasks
            and the tools/utils subfolders. They process the Govmeeting source files and produce
            the output that we see in the dist/dev and dist/prod folders.
            The tools folder also contains configuration files for controlling the behaviour of Angular2-seed.
            These are in tools/config and tools/env.
