Most of the files and folders in the root directory of the WebApp project are from the
angular2-seed project: https://github.com/mgechev/angular2-seed. Angular2-seed contains the
tooling that allows us to develop in a very modular fashion.

The folder "src" contains our source code for the application.
Most all of the other files and folders are part of the angular2-seed project.
The exceptions are:
     "GM_NOTES_xxxxxx.md"  - our documentation including this file.
