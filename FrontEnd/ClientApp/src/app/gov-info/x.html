    <h4>Austin, TX - City Government<br/>
        [ Wikipedia ]
   </h4>
    Austin is administered by an 11-member city council (10 council members elected by geographic district plus a mayor elected at large). The council is accompanied by a hired city manager under the manager-council system of municipal governance. Council and mayoral elections are non-partisan, with a runoff in case there is no majority winner. A referendum approved by voters on November 6, 2012 changed the council composition from six council members plus a mayor elected at large to the current "10+1" district system. November 2014 marked the first election under the new system. The Federal government had forced San Antonio and Dallas to abandon at-large systems before 1987; however, the court could not show a racist pattern in Austin and upheld the city's at-large system during a 1984 lawsuit. In five elections between 1973 and 1994 Austin voters rejected single-member districts.[240]

    <h4>Travis County - Government<br/> [Wikipedia]</h4>
    <p>
      Like other Texas counties, Travis County is governed by a Commissioners' Court composed of the county judge and four county commissioners. The court levies county taxes and sets the budgets for county officials and agencies. The judge and commissioners are elected for four-year terms (the judge at-large, and the commissioners from geographic precincts). The other major county-wide official is the county clerk, who maintains the county's records, administers elections, and oversees legal documentation (such as property deeds, marriage licenses and assumed name certificates). The clerk is also elected at-large for a four-year term.

  The Heman Marion Sweatt Travis County Courthouse is located in downtown Austin. The county courthouse holds civil and criminal trial courts and other functions of county government. As of 2017, the county's probate courts are in the process of being moved from the county courthouse into Austin's 1936 United States Courthouse, which was acquired by the county in 2016.[19]

      <h4>Texas - State Government<br/>  [ Wikipedia ] </h4>
      <p>
        Texas has a plural executive branch system limiting the power of the governor,
        which is a weak executive compared to some other states. Except for the Secretary of State,
        voters elect executive officers independently; thus candidates are directly
        answerable to the public, not the governor.[140] This election system has led
        to some executive branches split between parties and reduced the ability of the
        governor to carry out a program. When Republican President George W. Bush
        served as Texas's governor, the state had a Democratic lieutenant governor,
        Bob Bullock. The executive branch positions consist of the Governor,
        Lieutenant Governor, Comptroller of Public Accounts, Land Commissioner,
        Attorney General, Agriculture Commissioner, the three-member
        Texas Railroad Commission, the State Board of Education, and the Secretary of State.[140]

        The bicameral Texas Legislature consists of the House of Representatives, with 150 members,
        and a Senate, with 31 members. The Speaker of the House leads the House, and the lieutenant governor,
        the Senate.[141] The Legislature meets in regular session biennially for just over 100 days,
        but the governor can call for special sessions as often as desired (notably,
        the Legislature cannot call itself into session).[142]
        The state's fiscal year spans from the previous calendar year's September 1
        to the current year's August 31. Thus, the FY 2015 dates from September 1,
        2014 through August 31, 2015.

      <h4>United States - Government<br/> [Wikipedia]</h4>
      <p>
      The United States is the world's oldest surviving federation. It is a representative democracy, "in which majority rule is tempered by minority rights protected by law".[374] The government is regulated by a system of checks and balances defined by the U.S. Constitution, which serves as the country's supreme legal document.[375] For 2018, the U.S. ranked 25th on the Democracy Index[376] and 22nd on the Corruption Perceptions Index.[377]

      In the American federalist system, citizens are usually subject to three levels of government: federal, state, and local. The local government's duties are commonly split between county and municipal governments. In almost all cases, executive and legislative officials are elected by a plurality vote of citizens by district. There is no proportional representation at the federal level, and it is rare at lower levels.[378]

      The federal government comprises three branches:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Legislative: The bicameral Congress, made up of the Senate and the House of Representatives, makes federal law, declares war, approves treaties, has the power of the purse,[379] and has the power of impeachment, by which it can remove sitting members of the government.[380]
        </li>
        <li>Executive: The president is the commander-in-chief of the military, can veto legislative bills before they become law (subject to Congressional override), and appoints the members of the Cabinet (subject to Senate approval) and other officers, who administer and enforce federal laws and policies.[381]
          Judicial: The Supreme Court and lower federal courts, whose judges are appointed by the president with Senate approval, interpret laws and overturn those they find unconstitutional.[382]
        </li>
      </ul>
