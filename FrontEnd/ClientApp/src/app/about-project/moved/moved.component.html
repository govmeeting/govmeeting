Govmeeting provides the means to produce verbatim transcripts of public meeting.
It then processes those transcripts to extract all pertinent information:
<ul>
 <li>
   Bills that are proposed, debated or voted upon.
 </li>
   <li>
   Issues that were discussed.
</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li>
If meetings transcripts are available, it will use those.
</li>
<li>
If meetings recordings are available, it will generate transcripts using speech recognition.
</li>
<li>
Also., a smartphone app will be available for a volunteer to record a meeting and upload it.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Transcripts made from speech reconition must be proofread.
Here is the start of software being developed to <a [routerLink]="['/fixasr']">proofread a transcript</a>.
It splits the work into small size chunks that can be simultaneously worked on by a few
community volunteers.

The other manual step is to assign "tags" to parts of the meeting:

<h3> <a [routerLink]="['/viewmeeting']">4. View Meeting *</a> </h3>
After the pre-processing, fixing and tagging, we now have a browsable transcript.

<h3> <a [routerLink]="['/search']">5. Search Meetings</a> </h3>
The next step is to populate a relational database. Then we can search it in many ways.
