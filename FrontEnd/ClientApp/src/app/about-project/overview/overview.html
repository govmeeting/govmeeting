  The most important first feature for Govmeeting is to improve access to the content of government meetings.
</p>
<h2>The Before</h2>

Today our options for this are limited:

<p>Perhaps we have time to attend or watch the two to three hour meetings, though only a few minutes may be relevant for us.</p>
<p>Perhaps we can read meeting minutes on the town website. But these are missing the important discusssions.</p>
<p>If this is a large city, perhaps there are transcripts available.
      But they are usually not user friendly.
  <p>
  Here is a sample page from a Philadelphia transcript.
  It is 154 pages of double-spaced lines, 10-words-per-line. It is also in PDF format,
  making it unusable on small screens.
  Click: <button (click)="ToggleTranscript()"> {{showhidetranscript}} Sample Transcript </button>
<img [hidden]="!CheckShowTranscript()" (click)="ToggleTranscript()" src="/assets/images/Philly transcript page.png" width="900" alt="Philadelphia transcript page">
</p>
<p>
  Finding information is difficult. There is no table of contents. There is a computer generated single-word index.
  But it is meant for a legal researcher, not the average person. Click:
  <button (click)="ToggleIndex()"> {{showhideindex}} Sample Index </button>
<img [hidden]="!CheckShowIndex()" (click)="ToggleIndex()" src="/assets/images/Philly transcript index.png" width="900" alt="Philadelphia transcript index">
</p>

<h2> The After</h2>

Govmeeting will generate transcipts of government meetings, extract the information and populate a database.
Then you will be able to do the following:

<ul>
  <li> Go to a page where you see a list of all issues discussed at the meeting. </li>
  <li> Click on any issue and see all that was said on that issue. </li>
  <li> Click on the name of a speaker and see what he/she said. </li>
  <li> Do combinations of the above (see what someone said on a specific issue). </li>
  <li> Expand the criteria to past meetings. See everything ever said on an issue. </li>
  <li> Receive a summary of issues for each meeting via text message or email. </li>
  <li> Sign up to receive a email or text whenever a specific issue is discussed in the future.</li>
  <li> See statistics that compare issues for number of alerts on them, etc .</li>
  <li> See statistics that compare attendence and involvement of elected officials.</li>
  <li> Use graphical tools to view statistics.</li>
  <li> Hear any part of any prior meeting (depends on bandwidth). </li>
</ul>
