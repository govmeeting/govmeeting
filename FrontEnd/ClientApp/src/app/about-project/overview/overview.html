<p>
  To keep imformed of local town or city government activities, attending regular Council meetings is the primary first step.
  It is here where bills are introduced, debated and ultimately voted on. Here is where new issues are introduced. Here
  formal reports from the department heads are read and discussed.
</p>

<h2>Current Access </h2>

But getting access to this information is not easy:

<p>Perhaps some of have time to attend or watch all of two to three hour meetings But usually only a few minutes of each may be relevant to us.</p>
<p>Sometimes there are meeting minutes on government websites. But these are missing the important discusssions.</p>
<p>If this is a large city, perhaps there are transcripts available.
      But they are usually not user friendly.
  <p>
  Here is a sample page from a Philadelphia transcript.
  It is 154 pages of double-spaced lines, 10-words-per-line. It is also in PDF format,
  making it unusable on small screens.
  Click: <button (click)="ToggleTranscript()"> {{showhidetranscript}} Sample Transcript </button>

  Finding information is difficult. There is no table of contents. There is a computer generated single-word index.
  But it is meant for a legal researcher, not the average person. Click:
