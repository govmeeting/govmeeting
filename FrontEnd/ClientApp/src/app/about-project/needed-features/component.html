    <br /><h1> Other Features </h1>
  <p>

    These are some other features that will be added.

    <h2> Voice commands to fix errors </h2>

  <p>
    The <a [routerLink]="['/fixasr']">Fix ASR</a> page shows a program for
    correcting errors in the generated text.
    A user needs to TYPE the corrections. This new feature would allow a user to SPEAK the corrections.
    A user would listen to the meeting and watch the scrolling generated text. At any time, they could
    SPEAK a correction.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, suppose they hear "The street will be <b>paid</b> next week.". They could speak the correction
    by saying "will be <b>paved</b>". The software will use the start and/or ending words of the spoken correction
    as the "context" of the change. It this case, it would find "will be" in the immediate prior text and substitute
    the non-matching word "paved".

  </p>
  <p>
    "Speech recognition" is recognition of words of a single speaker. For a computer, this is much easier than conversional "voice recognition".
    The error rate for the spoken corrections should be much less than that of the original transcription.
  </p>

  <p>
    Users could use this method on smartphones and other mobile devices without keyboards.
  </p>

  <h2> Phone App to Record Meeting </h2>

  <p>
    Many places neither provide transcripts, broadcasts nor recordings of their meetings. In this case, the only option
    is for someone to manually record the meeting themselves on a portable device like a smartphone.
  </p>
  <p>
    A user will log into the app to start a recording.
    The user will need to have already been registered with the site for some specific community.
  </p>
  <p>
    The app will provide just the basic recording functions: RECORD, PAUSE, RESUME.
    Editing functions should be excluded, since we want a true and complete recording of the meeting.
  </p>
  <p>
    When the person chooses to upload, both the recording and the information about the government body will be sent.
  </p>

  The future home page should contain:

    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3> Control to select language. </h3>

            The user can select to see the site in their own language.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3> Brief project overview </h3>

            A paragraph or so and links to more information.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3> Register and Log-in links </h3>

            These are in the top right of all pages. After logging in, the user's name is displayed here.
