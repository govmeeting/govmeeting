  <h1> Future Volunteer Page </h1>
<p>
  This will be a page where volunteers can collaborate. The default content displayed will be related to their own home community
  and the status of their contributions.
  They can also browse content related to other communities. The page will include these elements:
</p>
<h3> List of current and past meetings and their status. </h3>
<p>
  This will show a listing of present and past meetings. It will show which have been processed and which still require work.
  If the user selects a meeting, either the "Work in Progres" or "Completed" details components below will be shown.
</p>

<h3> Work in Progress </h3>
<p>
  This will show the current state of progress on this meeting.
  If this meeting involves a recording, it will display a list of all the pieces that the recording was split into.
  It will show which pieces are (1) completed, (2) in progress and (3) not started.
  The volunteer can choose a piece of the recording to work on.
</p>
<p>
  Once someone start to process a piece, it is assigned to them until they either mark it completed or some (to be determined) time span elapses. <br />
  The volunteer can also choose to work on adding tags to a transcript that is ready for this step.
  In this case, the transcript will be assigned to them, until it is completed or after some time lapse.
</p>
<h3> Completed </h3>

This will show statistics on work that was completed: Number of volunteer contributing, time to complete, etc.

<h3> Volunteer chat box </h3>
<p>
  Volunteer who are logged in can chat among themselves. They can select to filter the chat room to see just those in thier own community,
  their own county, their own state, their own country or leave it open to everyone.
