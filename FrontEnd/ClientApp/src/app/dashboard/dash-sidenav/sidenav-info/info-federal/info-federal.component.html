  <h4>United States - Government<br/> [Wikipedia]</h4>
  <p>
  The United States is the world's oldest surviving federation. It is a representative democracy, "in which majority rule is tempered by minority rights protected by law".[374] The government is regulated by a system of checks and balances defined by the U.S. Constitution, which serves as the country's supreme legal document.[375] For 2018, the U.S. ranked 25th on the Democracy Index[376] and 22nd on the Corruption Perceptions Index.[377]

In the American federalist system, citizens are usually subject to three levels of government: federal, state, and local. The local government's duties are commonly split between county and municipal governments. In almost all cases, executive and legislative officials are elected by a plurality vote of citizens by district. There is no proportional representation at the federal level, and it is rare at lower levels.[378]

The federal government comprises three branches:
<ul>
    <li>Legislative: The bicameral Congress, made up of the Senate and the House of Representatives, makes federal law, declares war, approves treaties, has the power of the purse,[379] and has the power of impeachment, by which it can remove sitting members of the government.[380]
      </li><li>Executive: The president is the commander-in-chief of the military, can veto legislative bills before they become law (subject to Congressional override), and appoints the members of the Cabinet (subject to Senate approval) and other officers, who administer and enforce federal laws and policies.[381]
    Judicial: The Supreme Court and lower federal courts, whose judges are appointed by the president with Senate approval, interpret laws and overturn those they find unconstitutional.[382]
