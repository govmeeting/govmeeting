  <h4>Texas - State Government<br/>  [ Wikipedia ] </h4>
  <p>
    Texas has a plural executive branch system limiting the power of the governor,
    which is a weak executive compared to some other states. Except for the Secretary of State,
    voters elect executive officers independently; thus candidates are directly
    answerable to the public, not the governor.[140] This election system has led
    to some executive branches split between parties and reduced the ability of the
    governor to carry out a program. When Republican President George W. Bush
    served as Texas's governor, the state had a Democratic lieutenant governor,
    Bob Bullock. The executive branch positions consist of the Governor,
    Lieutenant Governor, Comptroller of Public Accounts, Land Commissioner,
    Attorney General, Agriculture Commissioner, the three-member
    Texas Railroad Commission, the State Board of Education, and the Secretary of State.[140]

    The bicameral Texas Legislature consists of the House of Representatives, with 150 members,
    and a Senate, with 31 members. The Speaker of the House leads the House, and the lieutenant governor,
    the Senate.[141] The Legislature meets in regular session biennially for just over 100 days,
    but the governor can call for special sessions as often as desired (notably,
    the Legislature cannot call itself into session).[142]
    The state's fiscal year spans from the previous calendar year's September 1
    to the current year's August 31. Thus, the FY 2015 dates from September 1,
    2014 through August 31, 2015.
